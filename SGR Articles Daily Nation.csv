The government is seeking Chinese loans to extend the railway to Malaba



**BY MOSES NYAMORI**


_resident William Ruto has_
_reversed his own policy on_
_the Standard Gauge Railway_

_land Depot af er his administra-_
_tion announced plans to contin-_
_ue with the two multibillion-shil-_
_ling projects._
_Transport Cabinet Secre-_
_tary Kipchumba Murkomen on_
_Thursday announced a planned_
_revamp of the inland contain-_
_er depot that Dr Ruto had in the_
_run-up to the August polls de-_
_scribed as a “selfi sh programme_
_to the detriment of the coastal_
_people”. The Ruto administration_
_is seeking additional Chinese_
_loans in billions of shillings to ex-_
_tend the SGR line to Malaba even_
_after it stoked controversy over_
_the contract that former Presi-_
_dent Uhuru Kenyatta entered in-_
_to with Beijing._
_Mr Murkomen yesterday told_
_Saturday Nation that implemen-_
_tation of the projects has “no con-_
_tradiction” with what Dr Ruto_
_said. He said this without provid-_
_ing any further explanation._
_Immediately after taking over_
_the Transport docket, the CS pro-_
_ceeded to make public part of the_
_SGR contract in what appeared_
_as an attempt by the new admin-_
_istration to scandalise the multi-_
_billion-shilling project._
_Mr Murkomen on Thursday_
_travelled from the Nairobi Rail-_
_way Terminal to the Naivasha fa-_
_cility through the SGR passenger_
_train in the company of Chinese_
_Ambassador Zhou Pingjian._
_“The government is keen to de-_
_velop the Naivasha Inland Con-_
_tainer Depot to handle goods_
_destined to various destinations_
_in the country and the region._
_We are also keen to utilise rail_
_transport, which is fast, safe, and_
_cheaper to enhance transporta-_
_tion of goods and people,” he said._
_“In the long run, we would like_
_to complete the connection of_
_the SGR from Suswa to Kisumu_
_through Bomet, Nyamira, parts of_
_Kisii and later to Malaba.”_
_Mombasa Governor Abduls-_
_wamad Nassir—who had wel-_
_comed Dr Ruto’s announcement_
_of the reversal of the Naivasha_
_ICD plan, and the reverting of_
_port operations to Mombasa—_
_yesterday said he has no prob-_
_lems with the revamp of the Na-_
_ivasha Dry Port so long as it will_
_not hurt businesses in Mombasa._
_“Every part of the country has_
_to grow economically. The facility_
_in Naivasha is good so long as it_
_is not done at the expense of oth-_
_er regions. As long as there is free_
_trade, there is no problem,” said_
_Mr Nassir._

_25,000 truck drivers and their as-_

_Prof X.N Iraki of the University_

_tend SGR to Malaba to connect_

_line. “It also makes strategic sense_
_to extend SGR to the Uganda bor-_
_der. Remember our railway was_
_originally Uganda railway,” said_
_Prof Iraki._


**RECEIVING END**


Prof X.N Iraki of the University of Nairobi said
“bastardising” the dry
port in the run-up to the
polls was purely politics
to appeal to the voters in
the Coast region.


Mbadi said extending the
SGR will force Kenya to
borrow additional billions
at a time when the economy is struggling.



_“Bastardising the Naivasha dry_
_port was politics. The reality is_
_that he has to start creating his_
_legacy. It is also possible that the_
_contract to extend SGR to Malaba_
_was already signed. I had predict-_
_ed that Ruto would not reverse_
_the SGR contract. The stakes are_
_too high. Did you notice China_
_never talked as that controversy_

_[on the contract] raged?”_
_ODM chairman John Mbadi, Na-_
_tional Assembly Minority Leader_
_Opiyo Wandayi and Vihiga Sena-_
_tor Godfrey Osotsi said the con-_
_tradiction “demonstrates lack of_
_coherence and clarity of policy_
_that has characterised the UDA_
_administration from day one”._
_Mr Mbadi said extending the_
_SGR will force Kenya to bor-_
_row additional billions at a time_
_when the economy is struggling._
_He termed it surprising that the_
_new administration has em-_
_barked on mega infrastructure_
_projects instead of supporting_
_the social economy for people to_
_have money in their pocket._
_“Whatever they said during the_
_campaigns was meant to hood-_
_wink voters. They were aware_
_that SGR was meant to link the_
_region, not just to end in Naiva-_
_sha. Extending it is not a bad idea,_
_but it means we will have to bor-_
_row more,” said Mr Mbadi._
_“The problem is that we have_
_hit our borrowing ceiling. Are we_
_going to continue with major in-_
_frastructure projects at the ex-_
_pense of economic growth? You_
_either continue with massive in-_
_frastructure projects or social_
_economic programmes.”_
_Mr Wandayi said it was disturb-_
_ing for the government to con-_
_tinue fl ip-fl opping on major pol-_
_icy decisions with far-reaching_
_economic implications, while Mr_
_Osotsi accused the new adminis-_
_tration of dishonesty._"

in a joyful and harmonious
atmosphere. Some people do
not like to see the deepening
cooperation between China and
Africa,” he said.
The very fact that the SGR
story was included in a performance for the Chinese audience,
he said, was proof of its importance to Chinese officials.
“It is good that when the
Chinese were celebrating the
Spring Festival, a play about
SGR was staged on the Chinese New Year eve TV gala,”
Mr Gang added.
Yesterday, reactions about
the play continued to flow.
Ms Stella Adhiambo Agara,
an activist, told the _Nation_ that
the depictions should make
Kenyans reflect on how the
Chinese viewed them.
“I’m convinced that China
holds Kenyans in very low regard,” Ms Adhiambo added.
But according to Prof Macharia Munene, such a skit has
no chance of ruining KenyaChina ties.
“That the Chinese...have
strange stereotypes about Africans is not news,” he said.
“It is similar to Donald
Trump saying Africa is a human
waste depository.”

Mr Zhang Gang, a spokesman of the embassy, told the

“ill-intended, distorting and

He blamed the western media

“We are not happy to see Kenyan media follow the western

The skit was aired by China

be the most watched TV event

However, in a performance
depicting a scene in Kenya
involving a Chinese man involved in the construction of
the standard gauge railway, a
Chinese actress who plays the
role of a Kenyan mother raises
eyebrows.
She painted herself black and
stuffed her undergarments to
look like she had a huge rear.
She also showed up on stage

Observers thought the

A trader was charged before a Milimani court in Nairobi with stealing
over Sh159 million from Dubai Bank
of Kenya.
Mr Justus Lindambizi Tito, however, denied that on diverse dates
between January 17, 2002, and June
26, 2015, at Dubai Bank Kenya, stole
Sh159,877,892.99 property of the
bank which is in liquidation. He also
denied conspiring to steal the said
amount with others.
The bank which faced financial difficulties was placed under statutory
management by the Central Bank of
Kenya before being liquidated.
Defence lawyers Kirathe Wandugi
and Ms Mwihaki Igoro told chief
magistrate Francis Andayi that the
case against Mr Tito will be consolidated with three others who were
top executives of the collapsed bank
and the case set for a pre-trial on

However, state prosecutor Kajuju

case will be consolidated with others and asked the magistrate to set

million – the originally agreed
compensation package – in court
in February last year.
Justice Mwita further ordered
that Sh77 million be released to
the National Treasury.
The fate of the Sh139 million
balance will be known after the
case between Mr Jhanda’s Altana Corporation and CMLTI is
determined.
The EACC has been looking
into claims that former NLC
chairman Muhammad Swazuri
tried to extort up to Sh200
million from CMLTI to secure
compensation for the land, where
part of the standard gauge railway
line sits.
Mr Jhanda’s Altana Corporation last year sued CMLTI in
Nairobi, claiming Sh139 million
in consultancy fees, arguing that
it helped the church group secure
compensation.
CMLTI had secured a Sh927
million compensation package.
Justice Mwita then ordered that
the Sh927 million be deposited in
court until the case is determined.
Separately, the EACC went to
the Kajiado High Court, arguing
that the value of the land had
been inflated and wanted payments stopped.
But late last year, EACC and
CMLTI struck an out-of-court
deal that was to see the church
group pocket a reduced figure of
Sh850 million for its land. This
almost wholly settled the Kajiado



case, with the only pending issue
being who pays the legal bills for
the suit.
Following the Kajiado outcome,
CMLTI successfully applied to
have Justice Mwita release Sh710
million to it and give the taxpayer
a Sh77 million refund.
Mr Jhanda had opposed the
application, arguing that his
firm would lose if the money is
released to CMLTI.
But Justice Mwita held that the
money sought to be released is
not the subject of any dispute
after CMLTI and the EACC had
settled the grievances they had.

Karembo, however, denied the

Court
orders
that the
institution
be paid the
cash after a
protracted
battle
involving
land and
anti-graft
agencies



**BY BRIAN WASUNA**

he High Court has ordered
that Clarence Matheny
〇〇〇

Institute (CMLTI), an American-owned church group, be
paid Sh710 million for its Ongata
Rongai property.
The institution had accused
National Land Commission staff
of soliciting bribes to secure
compensation for the land.
The prime land was acquired to
put up part of the standard gauge
railway phase 2A infrastructure
(Nairobi-Naivasha) but a threepronged fight erupted between
the church group, which owned
the property, the Ethics and
Anti-Corruption Commission
(EACC) and suspected fake gold
merchant Zaheer Jhanda.
EACC wanted to stop payment
of Sh927 million to CMLTI, arguing that the value of the land
had been inflated and that some
NLC and Kenya Railways officials
were set to benefit from bribes in
releasing the money.
The second fight saw Mr Jhanda’s Altana Corporation claim
consultancy fees of Sh139 million
from CMLTI.
After CMLTI sorted out its issues with the EACC out of court,
Justice Enock Chacha Mwita has
now ordered that Sh710 million
be released to the church group.
The NLC had deposited Sh927







Justice Mwita added that the
out-of-court deal was accepted
by another High Court judge,
and he has no constitutional
authority to revoke a decision
made by his peer.
Mr Jhanda’s Altana, the judge
argued, should have asked either
the same Kajiado court that
accepted the out-of-court settlement, or the Court of Appeal, to
stop execution of the deal.
Mr Jhanda has vowed to appeal
against the EACC-CMLTI outof-court settlement recorded in
Kajiado.
The EACC last year started
investigations into Dr Swazuri,
NLC deputy director of valuation
and taxation Joash Oindo and his
boss Salome Munubi over the
Ongata Rongai land saga.
Anti-graft detectives also held
that NLC illegally agreed to
pay CMLTI Sh98 million as
professional fees, relocation
and alternative accommodation
fees, which is not provided for
in Kenya’s laws on compulsory
acquisition of land.
A number of Kenya Railways
staff were also on the anti-graft
watchdog’s radar at the time,
and detectives believe that they
tried to use Mr Jhanda’s Altana
to receive their cut.
Should the EACC arraign Dr
Swazuri over the Ongata Rongai land, it will be the third set
of charges against the former
NLC boss.

The Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) yesterday stepped up
the push to have a referendum held
by end of July this year, with Siaya
Senator James Orengo asking the
National Treasury yesterday to present to Parliament a supplementary
budget to fund the exercise.
The Siaya senator spoke in the
presence of party leader Raila
Odinga in Ugenya yesterday at the
burial ceremony of Kahawa Wendani
MCA Cyrus Odhiambo, who was
found dead in a hotel room in India
on February 11, where he had travelled on official duty.
Mr Orengo made the remarks as
the ODM leader said no voice should
be stifled in the ongoing constitutional debate and asked those with
divergent opinions to feel free to
present their views.
Mr Odinga said because BBI was
for inclusivity, everyone should be
accorded space so that their views
can also be heard.
“We encourage robust discussion
around the constitutional review
process. We want everyone to bring
forth their views,” he told mourners
at the MCA’s Humwend home.

he building of the standard
gauge railway (SGR) and im## T provement of roads following

devolution has transformed Narok
County and increased the value of land.
New buildings are also coming up in
Maai Mahiu, Suswa and Satellite due to
SGR, with the areas also experiencing
increased demarcation of land.
In an interview with the _Saturday_
_Nation_, Narok Governor Samuel ole
Tunai said there was more in store
for residents following the completion of the railway in the area even
if its construction is not extended to
western Kenya.
The governor said the value of land
has risen, with a high number of people
buying in anticipation of later selling
at higher prices.
“An SGR station is being opened in
Narok. The railway is already transforming Narok’s economy even before
it starts operations,” said Mr Tunai.
Speaking at the Kichwa Tembo
Tented Camp in Maasai Mara, he said
the railway will ease transportation
of wheat, barley and other produce
to Nairobi and the Mombasa port.
Narok County leads in the production
of cereals


**Boost for economy**
A dry port and an SGR substation
will also be built in Suswa, Mr Tunai
added, and will create 21,000 jobs.
“The impact of SGR and the hundreds of kilometres of roads being
done in Narok is immense. Businesses
will grow. The economy is going to
grow fast,” said Mr Tunai, a close ally
of President Uhuru Kenyatta and his
deputy William Ruto.
Mr Tunai said the county government is promoting alternative dispute
resolution to address land problems
and that “it is working”.
The national government is tarmacking about 400km of roads in
the vast county that measures about
17,944 square kilometres. Governor
Tunai’s government has also acquired
equipment to improve roads for the
success of the county’s Integrated
Development Plan and the Big Four
agenda.
The infrastructure development is to



open up the county, a major producer
of wheat, barley, maize and potatoes
and enable growers to access markets.
The county, which also produces
sugarcane and livestock products,
lacked roads in some areas before
devolution.
“We decided to buy our own equipment and established the Narok Roads
Authority headed by an experienced
person. The authority has been functioning well and rehabilitating roads,”
said Mr Tunai. In an interview with
the _Saturday Nation_, he said all access
roads are being gravelled to ease access
to markets.
The county, he said, was also closely







working with the national government
to build roads, a relationship that
he said would highly transform the
county’s economy.


**Land prices rising**
A survey by the _Saturday_ _Nation_
indicated that the value of land has
tripled in Maai Mahiu, Suswa and Satellite where an industrial park — to be
served by the railway — will be located.
A 50m by 100m parcel that used to
fetch Sh300,000 in Suswa two years
ago is now selling at Sh1.5 million.
Many of those who bought land in
Suswa are from Nairobi, Kisii, Naiva


120km Nairobi-Naivasha line, which
I hear cost Sh150 billion. I believed I
would set up business near the SGR
phase 2A terminus in Suswa, but it
now seems impossible,” he added.
Mr Samson Momanyi, who also
bought land in the area, said the notion
they had was that the SGR project
would be “very huge because of the dry
port and create a lot of opportunities”.
“I was attracted to the dry port in
Kedong Ranch that partly touches the
Suswa market centre. I thought once
the project is completed, Suswa will
grow big as most container freights
will be located there. I had a plan to



sha and Nakuru.
But the failure to extend the railway
to Kisumu has dampened the hopes
of some investors.
When Mr Joseph Kamau bought
two acres of land adjacent to Suswa,
he thought he would soon reap big
if the SGR passed through Narok to
Bomet, Sotik and finally to Kisumu.


**Dreams of opportunities**
Speaking to the _Saturday_ _Nation_ by
phone, Mr Kamau said he bought the
land at Sh3 million last year, but feared
he could have burnt his fingers. “I

The Narok County government is
controlling the building of campsites
in the Mara Triangle in the Maasai
Mara National Reserve to protect
the ecosystem and boost tourism.
Only two campsites are in the area
as the county works to prevent the
mushrooming of buildings, Governor
Samuel ole Tunai said.
Wedged between the 400m-high

The Mara Triangle lies on the
western side of the Maasai Mara
where the Mara River forms a natural
boundary that embraces one-third
of the reserve. Most of the Mara
Triangle is part of the main reserve
and is not a private conservancy.
Due to its superb location, animals
freely wander between the neighbouring wildernesses, though the
river acts a natural fence that keeps

This outback also boasts an incredible, diverse landscape that includes

by the county, is on verge of dying
due to environmental destruction.
“The Mara will always be there.
The county government is conserving it for future generations. It will
not die. The game reserve will be here
until Jesus comes,” said Mr Tunai.
More than 10 conservancies have
been created around the park to
create a buffer zone, with residents
earning 19 per cent of revenue from
visitors. The conservancies have
restricted the number of vehicles to
protect nature.
The Maasai Mara is known as one
of Africa’s greatest wildlife reserves.
It is famous for the abundance of
the big cats — lion, leopard, cheetah
— and the wildebeest migration. The
Maasai people have also made the



park a darling of many due to their
distinctive custom and dress.
The park is a favourite for safari
lovers. The Maasai Mara Ecosystem
holds one of the highest lion populations in the world and is where
more than two million wildebeest,
zebra and Thomson’s gazelle migrate
annually.
The reserve stretches 1,510 square
kilometres and rises 1,500-2,170m
above sea level. It hosts over 95 species of mammals and 570 recorded
species of birds.
The wildebeest migration usually
occurs from July to October, although
it is not guaranteed that the wildebeest get to the Maasai Mara.
December to February is seen as
the best time to see the big cats as"

The presence of hawkers in the

them.
The World Bank has committed
Sh650 million towards the development of Mwariro and Karandini

will permanently host the hawkers who have been a menace in
the city centre.
Governor Mike Sonko said that

government has waived all fees
and approval charges towards
the project.
“The World Bank has given

Last November, Sonko said that
the county had identified Mwariro
Market as a permanent place to relocate hawkers who have invaded

He also revealed plans to acquire

~~Transport >~~ ~~Kenya Railways has been given a target of six million tonnes~~




After months of testing,
cargo can now officially
be transported from
Mombasa to Nairobi


**BY GITONGA MARETE**

ommercial operations of the
standard gauge railway freight
〇〇〇

more than six months of testing.
A Kenya Railways official yesterday
said after the tests that ran since SGR
launch last year, the corporation was
satisfied that operations would run
smoothly and is ready to open the
freight service to cargo owners.
On May 31 last year, President Uhuru
Kenyatta flagged off a cargo train at
the Mombasa port second container
terminal SGR marshalling yard ahead
of launch of the freight services.
The trains have since hauled thousands of metric tonnes of grains
including maize, imported through
the duty waiver window between May
and September 2017.
Kenya Railways managing director
Atanas Maina who was unavailable for
comment yesterday earlier indicated
it will cost Sh50,000 to ferry a 20
foot container from Mombasa port to
the Nairobi Inland Container Depot
(ICD).
Kenya Raiways will run freight trains



with 54 double-stack flat wagons, each
carrying 216 twenty foot containers,
each with a total load of 4,000 tonnes
on each train.
For six months after the launch of the
service today, KR has been given a target of six million tonnes to the Nairobi
ICD which has been expanded from a
capacity of 180,000 teus ( twenty-foot
equivalent unit) to 450,000 teus at a
cost of Sh21 billion. The 25-tonne axle
flat wagons have a capacity to carry a
payload of 70 tonnes and will move at
a speed of 80 kilometres per hour taking an average of eight hours between



Mombasa and Nairobi. This cuts the
rail transport service to half the time
the metre gauge trains tool to transport
goods between the two cities.
Freight operations on the SGR
will shift a significant load (over 40
per cent) to rail and will haul 4,000
tonnes per trip and 22 million tonnes
per annum. This is expected to translate
to less wear and tear on Kenya roads
and will significantly contribute to
growth in the nation’s GDP. Transport
stakeholders also say the development
is expected to see reduction of road
accidents, with reduced traffic.
However, there are concerns that
transporting goods by the SGR trains
might not be cheaper, with a section
of stakeholders saying cargo owners
will spend between Sh15,000 and
Sh20,000 on the last mile transport
to industries within Nairobi depending
on the distance from ICD, meaning the
cumulative cost could hit the Sh70,000
charged by transporters.
Truckers charge between Sh60,000
and Sh80,000 to ferry the same
container from the port to Nairobi,
depending on the weight and type
of cargo.
Mr Maina said they came up with
the rates that were deliberated upon
by industry players before launch of
the service. “We will also consider
how other charges that accrue before
cargo is delivered to the customer will
be handled,” Mr Maina said in an earlier
interview.

a bid by the Makueni County
government to downgrade Mtito
Andei to a lower tax regime that
signals imminent underdevelopment in the town, according to
residents.
Mtito Andei is the latest trading
centre along the corridor to suffer
an economic slowdown linked to
the realignment of a section of
the Mombasa-Nairobi highway
and the completion of the SGR.
The Makueni County 2019-2020
Finance Bill proposes, among
other things, to move Mtito Andei
from Zone A to Zone B — a lower
tax zone in urban classification —
following incessant complaints
that business in the town has
slumped.
While traders are excited about
the prospect of paying less tax,
other stakeholders feel the downgrading will condemn the town to
underdevelopment.
“Downgrading risks depriving
Mtito Andei of mega infrastructure projects that municipalities
attract,” said Mr Swaleh Makumi,
the chairman of an association of
traders in the town.
But he admits that business and
other economic activities in and
around the town have declined following the completion of the SGR.
Situated midway between Mombasa and Nairobi, Mtito Andei was
the headquarters of the defunct
Mtito Andei Town Council. The
town’s revenue base is pegged on
bars, restaurants and hotels, which
largely depend on passengers
in buses and lorry drivers and
conductors.
An ambitious government project to realign the Thange-Mtito
Andei section of the Mombasa-Nairobi highway in 2000,
ostensibly to avert frequent road
accidents, led to a business boom
in Mtito Andei. Most of the traffic
was directed to the town after the

ad the asbestos not been
exhausted and its harmful
〇〇〇

Andei would probably have grown
into a big industrial town along the
railway line. But decades later, it
is slowly dying, thanks to another
train track.
Derived from _mutitu wa ndei_
— Kamba for forest of vultures
— Mtito Andei was born in the
1800s as a barter trade station
for long-distance traders. Kamba
traders would travel to the Coast
with ivory and other items, which
they exchanged for other things
with Arab merchants.
The builders of the Kenya-Uganda Railway in the 1890s
had designated Mtito Andei as a
railway construction hub and later
upgraded it into a railway station.
Aided by the railway network,
mineral prospectors descended on
the region searching for minerals.
The discovery of asbestos was a
big boost for the nascent town.
In 1930, the colonial government issued Kenya Asbestos
Company exclusive rights to
mine the mineral at Kinyiki Hill
in Kathekani, on the fringes of
Mtito Andei. It was also granted
rights to prospect for other minerals. Another licence to prospect
had been given to geologist C.G.
Powell in January 1936.
With the closure of these mines,
all that remains today are the ruins
of what used to be a factory, a bay
for loading the commodity onto
trains and staff quarters. It is not
clear why Kenya Asbestos Company went under, in the process
dimming the economic prospects
of hundreds of households.
Nonetheless, Mtito Andei expanded steadily and became a
stopover on the Mombasa-Nairobi
highway. With that came restaurants, hotels and banks.
“The modern restaurants have
made the town the biggest stopover for buses and trucks in this
region,” said Mr Pascal Kyule, a
former Mtito Andei chief who is
a businessman in the town.
It is also a gateway to Tsavo
West National Park.
But with the launch of the
Standard Gauge Railway (SGR),
the town is facing a decline in
fortunes.
Residents are now protesting


〇〇〇


〇〇〇

neighbouring Machinery, Kwa
Kinyuti, Kwa Kithokoi, Kambu and
Hillside markets were bypassed
by the highway.
The good tidings changed in
2017 when the new railway line
was commissioned. With the SGR,
the number of buses stopping in
the town dropped significantly
following the introduction of the
Madaraka Express, the passenger train that runs on the new
railway line.
“Mtito Andei entertainment
joints and eateries record low patronage following the completion
of the new railway line, which has
taken many lorries off the highway,” said Mr Kyalo Laiti, a local
businessman who served as the
last chairman of the defunct Mtito
Andei Town Council.
The town’s nightlife glory is no
more, with neighbouring Makindu
and Emali now more popular with
patrons and partygoers.
Already, traders at Machinery
and Kambu are reeling from
the road realignment shock.
Their colleagues at Hillside, Kwa
Kithokoi and Kwa Kinyuti, which
also depended almost exclusively
on the busy highway, have closed
shop after the markets turned into
ghost towns.
Mr Kisivo Mulei, the owner of


〇〇〇

Okay Hillside Hotel — where more
than 1,000 passengers had meals,
drinks and snacks daily — said the
economic crunch has reduced his
establishment to a shell.


**Tips for bus drivers**
Mr Benson Musyoka, who owns
rental houses at Hillside shopping
centre, added: “Tenants have vacated all my 60 rooms.”
A spot check by the _Nation_
revealed that most restaurants tip
bus drivers with a plate of food
of their choice, a packet of cigarettes, a bottle of water and Sh200
to drop off passengers at their
premises. This “culture”, which
is as old as the town, is partly to
blame for the economic decline of
Mtito Andei, former Kibwezi MP
Onesmus Mboko said.
“Since it only takes a little
motivation for bus drivers to get
many clients at their doorsteps,
most service providers will tend to
be less bothered with provision of
quality service,” he said. “They are
more concerned with motivating
the bus drivers than satisfying the
clients. This approach to business
is not sustainable.”
That notwithstanding, it seems
the town that was born from one
railway line might die because of
another track.

_vice does not reach,” said Mr Ab-_
_di. The Kenya Ports Authority_
_(KPA) recently issued a directive_
_to shipping lines to allow nomi-_
_nation of cargo in Mombasa after_
_a four-year ban._
_“Before revocation of compulso-_
_ry usage of SGR to ferry cargo to_
_Nairobi, I was forced to park my_
_trucks as we did not have busi-_
_ness. All cargo was being nom-_
_inated to be cleared in Nairobi_
_and Naivasha and to be hauled_
_byvia trains,” he added._
_Nation yesterday established_
_that most of the traders had al-_
_ready shifted to Nairobi and the_
_announcement to return servic-_
_es to Mombasa could not affect_
_SGR volumes._
_“I have a long term contract_
_with Kenya Railways and I can-_
_not cancel it. With the adoption_
_of technology and paperless car-_
_go processing by KPA, I have no in-_
_tention to cancel my contract on_
_using rail,” said Mr Joseph Karan-_
_ja, a Nairobi-based businessman._
_A spot check by Nation at the_
_port yesterday revealed that,_
_over six months after the direc-_
_tive to return port services from_
_Naivasha and Nairobi to Momba-_
_sa, most clearing and forwarding_
_companies that had closed shop_
_have not reopened and many_
_have turned to technology to_
_transact._
_KPA Managing Director William_
_Ruto said at least 2,000 trucks_
_pick up cargo at the port of Mom-_
_basa every day._
_“There is an increase of cargo_
_volumes through Mombasa port_
_and each mode of transport gets_
_its share of cargo, which helps in_
_ensuring there is no congestion_
_at the facility,”Mr Ruto said._
_In the KNBS report, total month-_

_Mombasa dropped from 2.7 mil-_
_lion metric tonnes in November_

_A task force formed to investigate a controver-_

_from members of the public._
_Governor Wisley Rotich has tasked the_
_team to probe claims that a student place-_
_ment agency that shipped out more than 200_
_young people to universities in Finland to_
_study had inflated the tuition fee by almost_
_double the real amount._
_The team will also investigate why 23 would-_
_be beneficiaries have waited for more than_
_year to travel yet they have paid the requisite_
_fees in full. Education Executive Evans Kibor,_
_who doubles up as chairman of the task force,_



_said the 11-member team has begun its work._
_“We have not received grave concerns from_
_parents and students like those raised in_
_Uasin Gishu County [where a similar pro-_
_gramme has sparked a public uproar],” Mr Ki-_
_bor told Nation yesterday._
_Like Uasin Gishu County, the county govern-_
_ment acted as guarantor while parents ca-_
_tered for tuition fees, accommodation and_
_travel costs. The students were flown out in_
_groups of 25 but, in some cases, only 23 stu-_
_dents only applied, thereby delaying their_
_flight and commencement of studies._
_Tampere University of Applied Sciences had_
_indicated that the institution on March 1 ter-_

_to unpaid tuition and accommodation fees._
_In a letter dated March 7, the university_
_asked the affected students to liaise with their_
_parents to ensure that their tuition and ac-_
_commodation fees are paid by March 31, with_
_no possibility of an extension._
_Governor Wisley Rotich has said he is ne-_

_terms of engagement. He vowed to personal-_
_ly intervene in the matter to ensure students_
_from his county are not deported._
_“If it means traveling personally and mak-_
_ing a commitment to the universities in Fin-_
_land, then I will do it. There is a need for some_
_terms between the county and the universi-_

_land so that the government could_
_build the SGR. But they ended up be-_
_ing relocated further inland and_
_houses made from recycled oil drums_
_put up as compensation for their_
_land. According to sources, the few_
_who were paid received only Sh2,000,_
_although on paper it says they were_
_paid millions of dollars._
_They accused state officials and lo-_
_cal leaders of pocketing the funds. De-_
_spite the controversies connected to_
_its origin, Suswa town has seen en-_
_couraging growth. Barely five years_
_ago, the town only stretched two_
_streets off one side of the highway. Ei-_
_ther side of the highway now has four_
_streets. Hardware dealers are making_
_a killing from the construction, which_
_never seems to stop._
_Maragateway Resort, one of the new-_
_est hotels and which boasts the tallest_
_building in the town, has hosted sev-_
_eral investors who visit the port regu-_
_larly. A worker who is not allowed to_
_speak to the press told the Nation that_
_the hotel had profited from local and_
_foreign investors and its owners are_
_not worried about losing too much_
_business._
_“The owners were looking to lever-_
_age on the port, but luckily for us the_
_SGR has also attracted several tour-_
_ists who sleep here. Suswa is also locat-_
_ed on the way to the Masai Mara, and_
_some tourists like to sleep here before_
_proceeding to the game reserve. On_
_some weekends we are at full capaci-_
_ty,” the employee said._
_Eateries have been among the big-_
_gest beneficiaries of the port and the_
_SGR. Many people come to Suswa_
_town after finishing their business_
_at the port. Bars and liquor stores al-_
_so benefit. Dr Ruto’s directive has al-_
_so caused concern among KPA staff_
_working at the Naivasha ICD._
_A senior manager said nobody at the_
_facility is allowed to divulge any infor-_
_mation to the press without express_
_written permission from KPA’s Mom-_
_basa or Nairobi offices. However, he_
_said, the construction of the port will_
_continue and expressed confidence_
_that business will pick up._
_“In fact we are expecting two con-_
_signments this week. One from Grain_
_Bulk Handlers and another from_
_Mwango Huayi. They are among our_
_most regular customers,” he said._
_But one of his juniors said there is_
_confusion among staff, who are not_
_sure what will happen next._
_The Naivasha ICD has two perimeter_
_fences. The outermost one has not sur-_
_vived the wrath of vandals, who sell_
_the metal to scrap dealers._
_Wildlife is also a menace. Last Sat-_
_urday, a rogue elephant stormed the_
_facility and destroyed two gates and_
_part of the inner perimeter fence. En-_
_gineers from Nairobi arrived on Tues-_
_day to repair the damage._
_Perhaps the lot that is the happiest_
_about the directives are truck driv-_
_ers. The dry port had robbed them_
_of mileage allowance, which they are_
_hoping will now be back as cargo own-_
_ers return to road transport due to_
_lower operation costs. Mr Peter Mwan-_
_gi is an elated man. Before the shift-_
_ing of port operations to Naivasha, he_
_would do five or six trips to Kampala_
_and Kigali every month. However, af-_
_ter the new arrangements, he said he_
_was averaging two trips “which means_
_more money in my pocket.”_

_ne of President William Ruto’s_
_actions as the new Head of State_
_was to order the return of key_
〇〇〇

_dry port to Mombasa._
_He also vetoed the compulsory_
_transportation of cargo through the_
_Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) to Na-_
_ivasha for clearance. These directives_
_sparked celebration in the coastal_
_city, where hundreds of jobs were lost_
_when his predecessor’s 2019 directive_
_was effected._
_At the time, former President Uhu-_
_ru Kenyatta explained that the new_
_arrangement was aimed at reduc-_
_ing congestion at the Mombasa port_
_while speeding up the transportation_
_of cargo across the country._
_Cargo owners and transporters_
_were not pleased as it became more_
_costly to transport cargo by rail._
_Was the former President’s move_
_wise? The answer depends on whom_
_you ask. It is clear that the people who_
_depend on the port of Mombasa for_
_their livelihood have welcomed Presi-_
_dent Ruto’s directives._
_How have these orders affected the_
_people who have come to depend on_
_the Naivasha Inland Container Depot_
_(ICD)? Contrary to its name, the ICD is_
_actually in Suswa, a sleepy urban cen-_
_tre in the outskirts of Narok town and_
_approximately 65 kilometres from_
_Naivasha town._
_A few years ago, Suswa was a sleepy_
_backwater only known for hosting a_
_critical Kenya Power substation that_
_fed the national grid with electrici-_
_ty from different sources across the_
_country. The putting up of the ICD_
_and plans for a special economic zone_
_in the area helped jump-start Sus-_
_wa’s sluggish economic engine and of-_
_fered the small town hope of becom-_
_ing one of the biggest industrial hubs_
_in sub-Saharan Africa._
_Its growth was not meant to bene-_
_fit only big firms directly connected to_
_port business; small scale businesses_
_were also tipped to mint money by of-_
_fering support services to thousands_
_of workers at the ICD._
_Now, with the new developments,_
_this town risks joining the growing_
_number of Kenya’s white elephants,_
_which count in their ranks the Bura_
_Irrigation Scheme and the Bus Rapid_
_Transit system. Ms Beatrice Rioba em-_
_bodies the hope that came with the_
_ICD at Suswa; it saved her from a life_
_of frustration and hopelessness as a_
_jobless resident of Nakuru._
_In July 2021, Ms Rioba gathered her_
_life savings, borrowed some money_
_from friends and family, and moved_
_to Suswa. She set up what has been_
_the only kiosk outside the Naiva-_
_sha ICD for close to one year. The ki-_
_osk is in a rented container. Ms Rioba_
_sells fast-moving consumer goods like_
_milk, sugar, flour, cooking oil, and min-_



_eral water. For the time she has oper-_
_ated in Suswa and despite the tough_
_economic conditions, business has_
_been good. Workers employed by the_
_Kenya Ports Authority (KPA), Mitchell_
_Cotts, Mwango Huayi, and other com-_
_panies have become reliable clients,_
_mostly buying water, milk, and snacks_
_during mealtimes. She also serves_
_tourists who usually stop by to watch_
_the construction of the port._
_But things have changed in the past_
_week. Her stock is not moving as fast_
_as it used to._

**DASHED HOPES**


**Dry port could turn**
**into white elephant**


The putting up of the ICD
and plans for a special economic zone in the area helped jump-start Suswa’s
sluggish economic engine.
Its growth was not meant
to benefit only big firms directly connected to port
business; small scale businesses were also tipped to
mint money by offering support services to thousands
of workers at the ICD.
Now, with the new developments, this town risks joining the growing number
of Kenya’s white elephants,
which count in their ranks
the Bura Irrigation Scheme
and non-starters like the
Bus Rapid Transit system.



_ed with dead stock, I do not know_
_what to do. Very few trucks drive in-_
_to or out of the ICD. It is as though the_
_order to shift port operations put off_
_even the tourists that we had become_
_accustomed to seeing and serving,”_
_Ms Rioba told the Nation._
_She lives in Mai Mahiu, 35 kilo-_
_metres from the dry port. A return_
_trip costs her Sh200 every day. She_
_could comfortably afford this in the_
_one year she has done business in Sus-_
_wa. But in the past week, she has not_
_on any day sold enough goods to cov-_
_er the cost of her commute._
_Unlike Ms Rioba, for whom the ICD_
_and the new railway offered a new_
_lease of life, the only benefit Mr John_
_Chege Wanjiku derives from the SGR_
_is its overpass just outside Suswa_
_town, which provides a good shade_
_for his stall, protecting him from the_
_sweltering sun._
_Mr Wanjiku’s stall is located along_
_the Nairobi-Narok highway, and a_
_good chunk of his customers are trav-_
_ellers, especially truckers transport-_
_ing cargo. Transport of cargo to West-_
_ern Kenya via the SGR means less_
_truckers on the road and, by exten-_
_sion, less clients for Mr Wanjiku’s busi-_
_ness, which, like Ms Rioba’s, deals in_
_fast-moving consumer goods._
_“I do not see the benefit of the port_
_and the SGR. It has reduced the num-_
_ber of cargo trucks along the highway._
_Many youths from Suswa had been_
_employed as truck drivers, but they_
_were laid off when the industry suf-_
_fered a dip in business owing to the_
_SGR. Maybe with the transport of car-_
_go via SGR no longer compulsory, we_
_shall now see more trucks and for_
_people like me that means more cli-_
_ents,” the trader said._

_Another sore point about the devel-_
_opments in Suswa centre on the own-_
_ership of Kedong Ranch. Mr Wanjiku_
_understands the history of the con-_
_troversy well, having been born and_
_raised here. He even temporarily left_
_his business to participate in the fenc-_
_ing of the hundreds of acres of the_
_ranch together with several other lo-_
_cals. However, he soon returned to his_
_business when the promised pay was_
_inexplicably cut by half._
_As we spoke with Mr Wanjiku, a_
_group of his regular clients stopped by_
_to buy water. They are also locals who_
_own land in Kedong Ranch._
_One resident, who introduced him-_
_self only as Mancha, said land in the_
_area is in high demand as investors_
_seek to set up energy projects._
_“None of us will sell you land. Per-_
_haps those at the foot of the hills, but_
_not down here in the plains. The cur-_
_rent value is Sh1 million per acre,”_
_Mancha claimed. Kedong Ranch is_
_located near the ICD. The value of its_
_land was expected to rise when opera-_
_tions shifted to Suswa. However, locals_
_have for years been at war with the_
_owners, who accuse the firm of trying_
_to grab their ancestral land._
_Many herdsmen have been impli-_
_cated in vandalism, as they cut off sec-_
_tions of the fence to sell to scrap met-_
_al dealers. Just last Monday, police dis-_
_persed a group who were attempting_
_to invade the ranch._
_The standoff has sparked tensions._
_During the 20 minutes the Nation_
_team was at Mr Wanjiku’s stall, at least_
_three people stopped by to find out_
_what the crew’s mission was. They_
_have every reason to worry. Four years_

_he contracts for the standard_
_gauge railway (SGR) were signed_
_in a record two weeks from the_
〇〇〇
_proved, in spite of the magnitude of_
_the project and the huge financial ob-_
_ligation the government was placing_
_on its citizens._
_This, and the fact that Kenya Rail-_
_ways Corporation (KRC) experts dis-_
_missed and rejected the initial feasi-_
_bility study, is contained in commer-_
_cial contracts that the government_
_failed to disclose, even as it claimed to_
_have made public all the contracts re-_
_lated to the SGR._
_The undisclosed contracts that the_
_Nation has obtained were signed to-_
_wards the tail end of the Mwai Kiba-_
_ki administration and accelerated by_
_the Jubilee regime immediately after_
_taking power, despite sharp protests_
_from various government agencies_
_and certain quarters within KRC._
_As it is, the Kenyan government can-_
_not disclose or release the contents of_
_these contracts – courtesy of non-dis-_
_closure clauses placed on all of them –_
_without the approval of the China Ex-_
_im Bank that financed the construc-_
_tion, and the China Roads and Bridg-_
_es Corporation (CRBC), which was the_
_executor._
_“Each party understands to main-_
_tain the commercial confidentiali-_
_ty of any information, data or docu-_
_ment which it gains during the per-_
_formance of this contract and not to_
_make such information, data or doc-_
_ument available to any third party,”_
_reads the confidentiality clause on all_
_the contracts._
_This perhaps explains why Trans-_
_port Cabinet Secretary Kipchumba_
_Murkomen only released snippets of_
_the financial contracts, while ignor-_
_ing the commercial ones. While cam-_
_paigning, President William Ruto_
_promised to make public all SGR con-_
_tracts, ostensibly as a way of correct-_
_ing the wrongs done by his predeces-_
_sor Uhuru Kenyatta._
_Despite the government’s contrac-_
_tual inability to disclose the contracts,_
_the Nation can report that the deals_
_were not only rushed, but were made_
_with a clear intention to hand the_
_whole SGR project to CRBC from con-_
_ceptualisation to operation without_
_any avenues for oversight._
_Not only did CRBC do the feasibili-_
_ty study that was adopted, but it was_
_given the contracts for building the_
_SGR and provision of rolling stock, al-_
_lowed to supervise itself and to form a_
_company to operate the Madaraka Ex-_
_press that runs on the SGR._
_As if that was not enough, the Ken-_
_yan government exempted CRBC_
_from tax on all imported equipment_
_and materials, while allowing the_
_company and financiers to bar arbi-_



_contacts took place at an even fast-_
_er pace. The first one, for civil works,_
_was signed on July 11, 2012. The sec-_
_ond one, for the supply of locomotives_
_and rolling stock, was signed with CR-_
_BC on August 29, 2012. The third one,_
_for financing, was signed with China_
_Exim Bank on May 11, 2014._
_The civil works contract cost Sh290.9_
_billion for the 390km stretch be-_
_tween Mombasa and Nairobi which_
_is twice the cost of the Tanzania line_
_that is almost double the length and_
_is electrified. The Supply and Instal-_
_lations of Facilities, Locomotives and_
_Rolling Stock contract amounted to_
_$1,146,791,008.75 (Sh114.6 billion_
_at that time). This has, however, bal-_
_looned to Sh139 billion, according to_
_the current exchange rates._
_These two contracts were varied by_
_5 per cent each without proper justifi-_
_cations, courtesy of a variation clause._
_The civil works contract, for example,_
_was adjusted by Sh10,087,739,827_
_while the rolling stock one was in-_
_creased by $54,609,095 (Sh6.6 billion)._
_Explanations for these variations_
_were given as “price adjustments”_
_without any specifics._
_These variations caused the govern-_
_ment at one time to complain in a_
_meeting with CRBC officials, but this_
_only earned taxpayers a price reduc-_
_tion of Sh3 billion on the total contact._
_“Kenya Railways team considers the_
_unit prices of certain items too high_
_and discussed adjustments with CR-_
_BC,” states Minute 7 of a meeting be-_
_tween Kenyan negotiators and the_
_Chinese contractor on June 25, 2012._
_CRBC was soon after awarded a con-_
_tract to supervise itself through one of_
_its subsidiaries. On May 15, 2014, just a_
_few days before the government an-_
_nounced it had acquired financing for_
_the first phase, a consortium known_
_as TSDI was awarded the contract for_
_supervising the construction of the_
_railway at a cost of $41,184,638 (Sh5_
_billion). While this particular contract_
_was competitively sourced, TSDI and_
_CRBC are both owned by the Chinese_
_government._
_What this means is that companies_
_owned by the Chinese government_
_did feasibility studies for the SGR, fi-_
_nanced the project, built the railway,_
_brought rolling stock and are now op-_
_erating Madaraka Express. The Ken-_
_yan taxpayer, on the other hand, is fi-_
_nancing the repayments of the huge_
_loans taken for the project, and paying_
_a monthly fee to Afristar, the Chinese_
_government-owned company operat-_
_ing the Madaraka Express at a loss._
_Afristar, which is currently be-_
_ing paid Sh1 billion to manage the_
_SGR, has refused to hand over oper-_
_ations to KRC due to an existing debt_
_amounting to dozens of billions of_
_shillings. The Business Daily reported_
_last month that Kenya had been fined_
_Sh1.3 billion for late payments of the_
_SGR loan, even after wiring Sh22.7 bil-_
_lion to China in repayments._
_At the moment, the SGR is generat-_
_ing Sh15 billion only a year, against_
_operating costs of Sh18.5 billion. Rev-_
_enues are expected to tank further af-_
_ter President William Ruto reverted_
_cargo clearance services to the Mom-_
_basa port._


TOMORROW: How the prices of individual items used in constructing
the SGR were inflated. Plus, why the
Kenya Kwanza government is walking a tight rope on the SGR saga



**AT A GLANCE**


**The key issues in the**
**railway contracts**


1. Contracts were signed
within 14 days of the
feasilibility study being
adopted.
2. The construction company, CRBC was given
a lot of leeway in the
contracts, including
freely varying the bill of
quantities
3. Arbitration of any disputes arising from the
project will be done in
China
4. The company contracted to superise the
construction of the
railway is owned by the
Chinese government,
just like CRBC


_tration in case of disputes relating to_
_the project from being handled in_
_Kenya._
_Even worse, CRBC was given leeway_
_to adjust the prices of individual com-_
_ponents of the contract by making_
_the bill of quantities non-binding._
_“The contract price is to be adjust-_
_ed for rises or falls in the cost of la-_
_bour, goods and other inputs to the_
_works by the addition or deduction_
_of amounts,” says one of the contracts._
_All this was done in a record 14 days_
_from June 26, 2012 to July 11, 2012, be-_
_fore being withdrawn on March 14,_
_2013 just after President Kenyatta_



_won the presidential elections. They_
_were then reactivated on May, 11,_
_2014._
_Ideally, such a huge contract, re-_
_quires time for naming negotiating_
_teams, a board meeting by the con-_
_cerned authority, followed by seeking_
_and getting approvals from the minis-_
_try concerned and the Attorney-Gen-_
_eral. This is even before you factor_
_in the time needed to draft a bill of_
_quantities for the construction plus_
_the time needed for technical teams_
_from both sides, and lawyers to draft_
_and look at the details in the contracts_
_before financing is sought._
_And, whereas the official cost of the_
_project was put at Sh327 billion, the_
_open-ended nature of the contracts_
_allowed variations in the bill of quan-_
_tities without justification, leading to_
_irregular variation of contract prices_
_in several instances, making it impos-_
_sible to know how much the SGR re-_
_ally cost._
_For instance, while the Supply and_
_Installations of Facilities, Locomotives_
_and Rolling Stock contract was done_
_in US dollars, the Civil Works con-_
_tract was in Kenya shillings. Curious-_
_ly, the portion of repayment for the_
_Sh220,921,502,221 civil works con-_
_tract is in US dollars._

ncertainty surrounds the fate
of lucrative deals that appear to
〇〇〇

Mombasa-based private logistics firms,
including one linked to the family of
Mombasa Governor Ali Hassan Joho,
a near-monopoly in the transportation
of bulk cargo over the Standard Gauge
Railway (SGR).
After weeks of investigations, the
_Sunday Nation_ can reveal that the
Kenya Railways Corporation (KRC) is
desperately attempting to reverse the
heavily discounted rates granted to
Grain Bulk Handlers Limited (GBHL)
and Autoport Freight Terminals Ltd
(AFTL). A stormy board meeting on
Tuesday called for a review of the
terms, but it is unclear how this will
be done without exposing KRC to legal
challenges.
A draft documen t seen by the _Sunday_
_Nation_ indicates the two companies are to
enjoy preferential treatment to transport
cargo from Mombasa to Nairobi over
a 10-year period at up to 80 per cent
discount. This is against the maximum
volume discount of 10 per cent allowed
in the corporation’s tariff book.
Although it only accounts for two per
cent of the SGR business currently, the
controversial new railway project was
supposed to recoup most of the Sh500
billion of taxpayer money that has been
so far sunk into it through hefty Chinese
loans from the transportation of bulk
cargo (also referred as loose cargo) such
as cement, fertiliser, steel, klinker and
grains, among others.
Autoport is linked to the family of
Governor Joho, while GBHL is owned
by influential businessman Mohamed
Jaffer, who has dominated the handling
of grain and fertiliser at the Port of
Mombasa for decades.
Based on the draft documents, the two
companies have negotiated with KRC
into granting them a special rate of $450
(equivalent to Sh45,000) to transport a
wagon of loose cargo from Mombasa to
Nairobi, down from $2,147 (equivalent
to Sh214,700).
According to the KRC tariff book
released last December and which
took effect at the beginning of January,
conventional (bulk) cargo is charged at
$0.07 tonne/kilometre.
Therefore, transporting a tonne of
cargo over the 472 kilometres from
Mombasa to Nairobi will cost $33.04
(roughly Sh3,300). Since a wagon carries
65 tonnes, this translates to $2,147.6.
This is way more lucrative compared
to ferrying containers, which are charged
at a flat rate of $750 (Sh75,000) both
for the 20 and 40 feet containers from
Mombasa to Nairobi.
In order to be given the special rate,
GBHL and Autoport convinced the KRC
board of guaranteed business volumes:
GBHL promising to move 4.3 million
tonnes (equivalent to 66,153 wagons) per
year, while Autoport promised to move
1.6 million tonnes (or 24,615 wagons).
At the rate of $2,147, GBHL is supposed to pay KRC $142,030,491 (roughly
Sh14.2 billion) per year to carry the
66,153 wagons of bulk cargo from Mom


The board also agreed to lease to Autoport 26 acres out of the total 36 acres
at the NFT for a period of 45 years as
from December 1, 2018 subject to the
logistics company paying a stand premium of Sh78 million, exclusive annual
rent of Sh19.5 million, an application fee
of Sh5,000, pegging fees of Sh50, 000,
three months security deposit of Sh4.88
million and administrative charges of
Sh100,000 — all totalling Sh103 million.
However, during the 415 [th] meeting on
November 6 last year, the board was notified by acting managing director Philip
Mainga that Autoport had appealed for a
waiver of all terms in the letter of offer.
The firm cited KRC’s approval of the
same to GBHL in leasing the Athi River
property as its grounds for appeal. Our
sources say that the business and operation committee of the board rejected
Autoport’s appeal, but the full board in its
meeting of December 4, 2018 overruled
the committee, thus waiving all fees
payable by Autoport as well granting
their request for a preferential for $450
wagon as opposed to $2,147.
“Even as they did so, the board did not
independently assure themselves of the
impact of providing an exclusive discount
to Autoport,” said a top placed source at
KRC who is aware of the negotiations.
But Mr Waweru, the KRC board
chairman, said nothing had been agreed
in leasing the properties to the two
companies.
“Yes, they have applied to be given
these facilities and we are considering
their applications based on the volume
of business they will bring,” he said.

basa to Nairobi.
However, with the hugely discounted
rates of $450, it will only pay $29,768,850
(roughly Sh3 billion) to transport the
same number of wagons to the capital
city, translating to a difference of at least
Sh11 billion.
On the other hand, Autoport would
ideally pay KRC $52,848,405 (Sh5.28
billion) to transport the 24,615 wagons
it has promised to move. However, with
the preferential rate of $450, it will now
pay $11,076,750 (Sh1.1 billion), which
translates to a difference of about Sh4.17
billion per year.
Over a ten-year period, this will come
to $1.23 billion, equivalent to Sh123 billion
or roughly a third of the Sh327 billion
it cost to construct the railway from
Mombasa to Nairobi.



“With the much-subsidised rates, the
two firms will enjoy. It will be almost
be impossible for any other player to
challenge them in the bulk-cargo transportation business,” said a senior official
in the Transport ministry, who is aware
of the contracts but requested anonymity
to give background for this article.
At a time when KRC is struggling to
bridge the gap between its operating cost
and the revenue generated from the SGR,
the pair of deals could severely dent the
prospects of the SGR ever turning in a
profit in the long-run.
Mr James Macharia, the Transport
CS, which is KRC’s parent ministry,
distanced himself from the discount
debacle.
“Those questions relate to the operations of KRC and decisions which
may have been taken by the board of
management with the oversight of the
board. I request that you contact the
chairman of the board for comprehensive
responses,” he said in response to our
enquiries last week.
Mr Michael Waweru, the chairman of
KRC board, said last week that no final
agreement had been signed with the
two companies, but added that the draft
documents had been shared in “error.”
“There is no contract and if anyone has
one let him produce it,” he said.
He added: “The board met on Wednesday (two weeks ago) and we agreed that
our customers will be given discount
based on their investments and volumes
(of cargo) they are handling. We are
developing a policy that will guide this
and once it is ready we will forward it
to the minister for approval. What you
have are draft documents that were given
out in error,” said Mr Waweru, a former
Commissioner-General of the Kenya
Revenue Authority. This was before the
latest board meeting last Tuesday.
The owners and the management of
both GBHL and Autoport did not immediately respond to our requests for
comments sent out in the last two weeks.
A well-placed source at KRC said that
when the board met on Tuesday this
week, it resolved to do away with the
preferential rates altogether. However, he
said, the GBHL and Autoport contracts
have already been signed and could cause
legal problems to KRC.
In addition to the preferential rates,
KRC had agreed to lease two of its key
facilities in Nairobi to the two firms for
free for a period of 45 years.
First, in mid-2018, it gave GBHL 60
acres from the 900 acres the corporation is acquiring from the East African
Portland Cement in Athi River for the
development of its (KRC’S) bulk terminal
and transshipment facility.
GBHL requested for the land to
construct its own logistics centre at an
estimated cost of more than Sh10 billion,
said a well-placed source at KRC who is
familiar with the negotiations.
Since GBHL was going to pump colossal amounts in the construction of
the logistics facility, it requested that
it be exempted from paying millions of
shillings in stand duty, annual rent and
any other statutory fees, said our source.
“The company is investing billions
of shillings, building that facility from
scratch,” a source at the company, who
spoke in confidence, said in an attempt
to defend the deal.
It wasn’t long before Autoport followed
suit with a similar request.
During KRC’s 410 [th] Special Board
Meeting on September 26, 2018, the
board approved Autoport’s application
to lease part of KRC’s land at the Nairobi
Freight Terminal (NFT) in Nairobi South.



control of a strategic public asset as
the terminal to a private firm, he said
“our business is not to run ports or
ICDs (Inland Container Depots) but to
transport cargo.”
A source at KRC, who spoke to us
in confidence, revealed that GBHL has
now written a letter of complaint to CS
Macharia copied to Head of Public Service Joseph Kinyua claiming exclusivity
for the bulk cargo deal.
“GBHL also feels that Autoport has
been given an undue advantage since
it is inheriting a running public facility
to handle its cargo, while GB HL will be
expected to pump in billions of shillings
to set up its own facility,” he said.
Multiple sources at KRC said that
although Autoport already has a signed
contract, the minutes of the December
4, 2018 board meeting that granted the
company concessionary rates had not
been confirmed.
But even after the board gave the
greenlight to the NFT deal in December,
the signing of the contract delayed as
officials at the corporation sharply differed over a special condition in the offer
letter which Autoport had objected to.
The special condition number four
in the letter stated that “The Lesee
(Autoport) acknowledges its association with Portlink Logistics Ltd and
undertakes to cause to Portlink … to
withdraw the arbitration claim against
the corporation and further surrender
the s ubject land to the corporation.”
In 2015, Portlink sued KRC for attempting to illegally terminate a contract
for a 0.692 acre parcel of land the former has leased from the latter near the"

ow can Kenyan towns move large
numbers of people efficiently,
〇〇〇

relative comfort at all times?
This is the question that policymakers, transport and infrastructure
planners should have been seeking
answers to in the wake of the strike by
matatus earlier this week.
It is a question that the government
has failed to answer comprehensively
and this has resulted in the gridlocks
that have come to characterise virtually every major town in Kenya, from
Mombasa to Meru, Nairobi, Nakuru,
Eldoret and Kisumu.
The problem with expanding roads
has been that Kenyans have been buying
personal cars in increasing numbers in a
private quest to solve a public transport
problem. Because matatus do not guarantee safety, have no regular schedules,
no fixed prices and no set number of
passengers, Kenyans who seek these
conveniences in transport services have
no other recourse but turn to personal
cars, even if they have to incur debt to
satisfy this need.
But if there is one lesson that the
Standard Gauge Railway should teach
policymakers, urban planners and
transport aficionados, it is that the market for regular, safe and reliable mass
transit system remains untapped. It is
not for nothing that the SGR, despite
the questions raised about its cost,



has moved two million passengers in
the short period it has been operating.
Yet, this is just one line with no feeder
system of inter-linked railway lines.
There is no reason why, for instance,
counties like Nakuru, Uasin Gishu,
Kisumu and adjoining areas, where
the old railway passes, cannot come
together and put a regular train to work,
connecting these regions to each other
and to Nairobi, where they can be linked



to the SGR. Just doing this alone, say
over the festive period when Kenyans
travel en masses across the country, will
not only serve to stabilise bus fares — a
constant headache that Kenyans have
to endure every time there is a holiday
— it will also provide a large number of
travellers with an option that is reliable
and much safer than Public Service
Vehicles (PSVs).
In the past, for instance, it was
possible for one to catch a train, say
from Kenyatta University to Karatina
and all the way to Nanyuki. Today, the
only viable transport between Nairobi
and the greater Mt Kenya region is the
road, which narrows to a lane either
way from the Kenol junction.
The result is that this road is clogged
every weekend, a bad situation made
worse by police road blocks and the
occasional accident, such as the one
involving a tanker that overturned
atop the Sagana River Bridge, virtually
cutting off that part of the country for
an entire day.
Although a flight from Nairobi to
Nyeri has been introduced, this will only
address the top tier of the transport
market, leaving the bottom of the pyramid at the mercy of the Nissan matatu
since there are no buses that ply that
part of the country besides Kensilver
and Kenya Mpya.
And, whereas the former has a relatively sound safety record, the same
cannot be said of the latter. It should
come as a surprise that the Transport
Ministry has only asked Kenya Railways
to increase the frequency of commuter
train services in the capital for the duration that matatus were on strike. What
happens once the matatus are back
on the road? Will that mean that the
trains go back to their two trips a day
schedule when clearly there is a market



for regular services between the Central
Business District and adjoining areas?
The problem with this thinking is that
it assumes only regular workers need
transport to take them to their jobs in
the morning and back to their homes in
the evening. This is the wrong model to
premise a transport system on.
Public transport is for all people,
including tourists, traders, idlers,
fun-seekers, errand runners and all
other people who, for one reason or
another, need to move from one point
to the next.
The large numbers of people who
used the trains during the two days
of the strike should, therefore, be
a wake-up call to public transport
planners to increase train services
countrywide because the market exists
as has been demonstrated by the SGR
service between Nairobi and Mombasa.
Much as the idea of introducing a Bus
Rapid Transport (BRT) is welcome, it
will be fraught with challenges unless
it is conceived as a supplementary idea







to railway transport.
For one, the Internal Security Ministry will need an inordinately large
number of police officers to ensure
that other road users respect the
BRT lane. No public education has
been conducted on how that lane is
to be used.
Introducing a bus one morning will
therefore not be the silver bullet that
authorities think will solve urban trans
port challenges that all key towns face.
Even with the line, all the other lanes
will continue to look like endless trains,
with one or two people in each cabin.
The question that authorities should
be asking is: How do we make it both

unnecessary and convenient for all
who drive to work to drive themselves?
Increasing parking fees, as the Nairobi City County has proposed in its
budget, is unlikely to deter self-driving
workers.
After all, increasing parking fees
also increases the probability of one
getting a parking slot. Cities like

Lake Turkana Wind Power (LTWP)
project's arduous decade-old journey
from humble origins to Africa’s largest
wind farm and Kenya’s single largest
private sector investment has encountered many obstacles.
But nothing has tested the collective
resolve of both the public and private
stakeholders involved in this project
more than the barrage of negativity that
has engulfed what should have been a
joyous occasion when the much-awaited
436km transmission interconnector
linking the 310.25MW power plant to the
national grid at Suswa was energised,
paving the way for clean, reliable and
affordable power.
This is a private company that has
set the benchmark for how successful
infrastructure projects will be undertaken in Sub-Saharan Africa; a project
that places Kenya firmly on the global
map in so many positive ways, a project with a financing structure that is
hard to replicate and a transformative
undertaking that has offered hope and
potential to the residents of one of the
most neglected parts of Kenya. Why
then has LTWP not (yet) succeeded



in being the game-changer it was set
out to be? What does this landmark
project’s experiences spell for similar
undertakings?
It is easy to get waylaid by sensation
and focus on the much-reported 46
million Euros paid by the Government
of Kenya (GOK) to LTWP for the Transition Interconnector Delay Deemed
Generated Energy (TI Delay DGE)
payments in 2017 and the corresponding 0.00845 Euros per kWh that will be
added on to power bills for six years (at
which rate, LTWP’s tariff is 8.53 Euro
cents per kWh). There is nothing sinister about this. LTWP has explained,
in full transparency, the genesis, need
and result of this.
Any attempt at trying to discredit
LTWP or GOK is futile and LTWP has
been not only utterly patriotic in how
it worked hand in hand with GOK to
resolve this as painlessly to Kenyans as
possible, but unbelievably transparent.
Equal effort has gone into explaining
the most complex technical aspects of
capacity factors, Megavars and Megawatts, cold and hot commissioning and
a myriad other aspects that frankly,



night and import during the day? Will
tariffs go up or down? Should KPLC’s
monopoly be lifted (bad idea incidentally)? How do we grow demand (the
only way tariffs will come down)?
The fact is that LTWP is a disruptive entity that has shaken the core of
Kenya’s energy sector and opened up
the sector to a level of scrutiny hitherto
never witnessed. It has shone a light on
how traditional infrastructure projects
are undertaken.
It has demonstrated the benefits
of public-private partnerships. It has
shown the power of the people and
a Government determined to make a
difference. We were not perfect, nor was
any other stakeholder involved. But,

cut down travel-time from Laisamis to
Sarima by over a day and opened up
trade, investment and economic activity
to an area previously marginalised, and
has radically improved security, health,

However, the door was locked from
inside.



""We broke the door and found the

he amount of debt falling
due this year has dropped
〇〇〇
onciliations passed through the
supplementary budget by the
National Treasury.
The drop has revised what
Kenya planned to pay this year
to Sh253.2 billion, down from the
Sh282.3 billion that was contained
in the original budget for 2019/20.
The revision comes at a time
Kenya has started talks with foreign lenders with a view of getting
repayment holidays at a time the
world is headed into a recession
due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
President Kenyatta revealed last
week that Kenya had opened talks
with external lenders to suspend
debt during the Covid-19 crisis.
“We’re in discussion with the
largest economies in the world
on the issue of suspension of debt
for a period in order to allow us
to spend more combating this
pandemic,” the President said
Other regional and global institutions, such as the African
Development Bank and the Africa
Import Export Bank, have created
emergency credit facilities that
Kenya plans to tap into, he said.


**Return to full production**

“We will use these facilities to
support producers and exporters
so that they can return to full
production and protect jobs and
livelihoods,” Mr Kenyatta said.
A third of all the debt billions
that fall due this year belong to
China, through the Exim Bank
of China and China Development
Bank, making the Asian nation
one of the key countries Kenya
must engage in tackling the debt
headache.
Data from the National Treasury
shows that the two banks expect
a total of Sh78.4 billion this year.
Out of this, Sh23 billion will go
to the principal repayments owed
to the Exim Bank of China. An
additional Sh37.8 billion will be
interest owed to it.
This amount would have been
Sh10.5 billion more had China not
delayed by six months disbursement of the first tranche for the
Standard Gauge Railway (SGR).


**The grace period**

“We don’t have a debt relief.
The overall decrease in principal
payments of Sh10.5 billion is
mainly due to pushing forward one
principal payment for SGR loan
which was to be paid in July 2019
but was instead paid in January
2020 because the first disbursement to SGR came late,” Treasury
Principal Secretary Julius Muia
told the _Nation_ in a short message.
“The grace period was therefore
moved forward by 6 months,” he
added. This means that, instead
of paying Sh33.5 billion to Exim
Bank as principal, Kenya will pay
Sh22 billion.
Sh22.3 billion owed to China
Development Bank is also maturing this year. Sh17.5 billion is the
principal, while Sh4.7 billion will



be interest payments.
Treasury Cabinet Secretary
Ukur Yatani explained the budget
reduction thus: “We expected
higher interest rates on domestic
debt after lifting interest rate caps.
This did not happen.”


**Earlier maturities**

This saw a saving of Sh19.9
billion, which brought the total
reduction to Sh29 billion.
“On China, we had assumed
earlier maturities, which wasn’t
the case. The adjustment reflects
actual position after reconciliation,” the CS told the _Nation_ .
The maturity of the Eurobonds





has also come at a bad time for
Kenya. This will see Kenya pay a
total of Sh48.9 billion in interest
payments for the three Eurobonds
taken between 2014 and 2019.
Treasury data shows that Sh14.5
billion will go towards servicing
the debut Eurobond where Kenya
took a total of Sh275 billion
($2.75billion).
Another Sh16.6 billion will go
towards paying the 2018 Eurobond
where Kenya borrowed Sh200
billion ($2billion). The 2019 Eurobonds will attract interest of
Sh17.2 billion.
Besides the Exim Bank of
China, the other significant cred


itor that Kenya should be talking
to is the Trade Development Bank
(TDB). Sh43.3 billion will mature
this year. This is Sh26.2 billion for
debt redemption and Sh17 billion
as interest.
Other top lenders include IDA
(Sh27.3 billion), France (Sh17.5
billion), Italy (Sh8.9 billion),
Japan (Sh5.7 billion) and ADB/
ADF (Sh8.1 billion).
Others are Germany (Sh2.9
billion) and Spain (Sh2.2 billion).
The amounts include debt redemptions and the interests that
fall due in the current financial
year. The exchange rate used is
Sh100 for every dollar.


**Urgent renogotiation**
Depending on the exchange rate
at the time of repayments, these
amounts can reduce or increase
for debt denominated on foreign
currency such as the Eurobond.
However, it is not the current
debt for this financial year that
should worry Kenya. The debt that
falls due from the new financial
year that starts in July is what
needs urgent renegotiation given
that this is when the impact of the
Covid-19 pandemic will properly
hit the economy.
In the new financial year that
starts on July 1, Kenya will need
to pay a total of Sh630.1 billion.
In Mr Yatani’s debt repayment
strategy, unveiled this year, Treasury was going to use the increase
in tax collections and all the savings from ministerial budget cuts
to repay the debt and deal with the
ballooning pension bill.
The strategy, outlined in the
2020 Budget Policy Statement
(BPS) said that the bulk of the
savings would go towards the
Consolidated Fund Services,
specifically for debt repayment,
pensions and gratuities.
Kenya’s total debt reached a new
high of Sh6.3 trillion on March 20.
This position has been made worse
by the depreciation of the shilling,
which has reached an average of
Sh106.7 to the dollar, one of the
lowest this month.
The debt position will get worse
in coming months as the shilling
weakens further, given that most
of Kenya’s debt portfolio is dollar
denominated.


**Domestic debt**

Data from the Central Bank
of Kenya (CBK) shows that, as
at March 20, Kenya’s domestic
debt stood at Sh3.04 trillion. A
bulk of this — about Sh2 trillion
— comprised of Treasury bonds.
Treasury bills excluding repos
stood at Sh925 billion.
The rest of the debt was in the
form of overdrafts at the CBK
and other domestic debt, which
includes clearing items in transit,
advances from commercial banks,
Pre-1997 Government Overdraft
and Tax Reserve Certificates. This
is according to the CBK’s weekly
bulletin dated March 20.
The latest figures on the external debt are is $30.66 billion or
Sh3.27 trillion with the local unit
at 106.7 to the dollar. This brings
the total debt portfolio for Kenya
at Sh6.3trillion."

bitter battle is simmering
among key government agen## A cies that have been operating at

the ports of entry following a surprise
directive that has seen most of them
kicked out.
The move, meant to improve
operations, especially at the port
of Mombasa, has triggered an inter-agency row, with some warning
of security risks and an influx of
counterfeit goods, the _Sunday Nation_
has learnt.
In a radical move, a memo sent
from State House on June 4 removed
more than 20 agencies from the
ports. Major agencies with restricted
access to cargo clearance include the
National Intelligence Service, the
Directorate of Criminal Investigation,
Kenya Plant Health Inspectorate Services and the Anti-Counterfeit Agency.
The memo first grouped the agencies into five categories with only
Immigration, Port Health and Port
Security Office, Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA), Kenya Ports Authority
(KPA) and Kenya Bureau of Standards
(Kebs) allowed full access.
Others have to seek authority to
enter the ports by filling in an accountability form with the name of
the officer to be allowed into the port
areas, a move said to be opposed by
those affected.
Most senior officials did not want to
comment on record about the circular,
underscoring the power with which
it was delivered.
“Agencies in category three will
undertake any cargo related intervention after making a formal request to
the Head of the Lead Agency using
the Port Entry Accountability Form,”
Mr Joseph Kinyua, head of public
service, wrote.
The letter also indicated that Kebs
will be the lead agency in coordinating
inspection of goods at the country
of origin and the issuance of Certificate of Conformity to ensure quality
standards “and the adherence to other
regulatory requirements”.
Category three include the NIS,
DCI and Kephis.
From the new port operations
structure, Kebs and KRA will remain
the most critical agencies in handling
cargo, a move that is expected to save
importers the lengthy clearance process that was driven by the presence
of several agencies within the port.
It is this dominance by the two
agencies that has sparked jitters
among other agencies who fear they
may not get sufficient support from
the two based on past experiences
that forced their inclusion at the port
in the first place.
But it is the requirement to seek
permission from lead agencies that
seems to be causing anxiety.
“What if we seek permission and
they don’t grant it? What are we supposed to do when we know some cargo
is suspected to be either counterfeit

Kenya Ports Authority says the implementation of the new directive at the port
of Mombasa has begun to improve operations, with container evacuation increasing
significantly in the past one week.
The port's General Manager for Operations and Harbour Master Capt William
Ruto yesterday said the port had exceeded
its performance target of handling more
than 150 containers per hour.
Mr Ruto said container evacuation by
the Standard Gauge Railway performed
well as out of 1,210 containers destined
for the Inland Container Depot Nairobi
(ICDN) on Friday morning, 710 containers
had been moved within 14 hours.
""The ICDN has attained the highest
performance ever, with 1,107 TEUs (twenty-foot equivalent units) being delivered in
the past 24 hours,"" said the harbour master.
Mr Ruto attributed the efficiencies being
noticed at the moment to the recent government directive to reduce the number
of government agencies involved in cargo
interventions.
Performance is also said to have improved in offloading containers.
“The recent changes have made operations easier and we expect no congestion
at the port,” said the captain.
At the same time, Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) will be implementing the
integrated Customs Management System
(iCMS) for both imports and exports
starting July this year.
The move targets different stakeholders


Captain William Ruto.


2019/2020 financial year budget.
The stringent customs clearance procedures aims to speed up clearance of cargo
at the Port of Mombasa, Inland Container
Depot Nairobi (ICDN) and other border
points.
In its notice to the public, the authority
has notified importers and exporters that
all cargo clearance documentation will as
from July 7 this year be submitted through
iCMS after the authority solved all hitches
affecting the use of the system.
“Kenya Revenue Authority notifies the
shipping lines/agents, importers, exporters,
clearing and forwarding agents, consolidators and all other parties related to cargo
clearance process of the commencement of
implementation of the iCMS at the Port of
Mombasa, ICDN and the border stations,”
stated part of the statement issued by
Commissioner for Customs and Border
Control, Mr Kevin Safari.
The announcement also calls for the
business community to submit sea manifests for both imports and exports in
iCMS through the system to system data
exchange 48 hours before a vessel arrives
or departs.



or illegal and we cannot access the
port? This is going to open a can of
worms and we have been here before
when Kebs, for example, would clear
the goods only to be confiscated by
another agency for violating some
laws. At the end of the day, the same
traders will be inconvenienced,” said
a source from one of the agencies



kicked out by the June directive.
There are also questions on the
decision to restrict access for the
NIS and the DCI, who have in recent
months been involved in operations to
intercept smuggled and illegal goods.
The circular also directed that all
the agencies involved in cargo handling start operating on 24-hour basis,
every day of the week in a move that
could require the hiring of more staff.
A powerful lobby under the umbrella of Small Traders and Importers
Association is said to have decried
the existence of several agencies at
the port, which was delaying clearance of their cargo, which come in
consolidated containers and which
are usually candidates for thorough
verification due to risks of misdeclaration and counterfeiting.


**President’s intervention**
Last month, President Uhuru visited the Inland Container Depot in
Nairobi where goods worth billions of
shillings are being held after meeting
a section of the “small traders” at

State House.
The two high-profile visits led to
the intervention of the President, who
also called for vetting and gazettement
of all the cargo consolidators before
they are allowed into the import-export trade.
The traders’ clearance tussle with
KRA started from suspicion that the
importers were trying to dump the
Sh14 billion cargo within the country
after declaring them as transit goods
to Uganda.
The goods imported mainly from
China would have denied KRA some
Sh4 billion in tax revenue.
“There are people who engage
in consolidation. They bring goods
in containers, claiming they are in
transit while their real motive is to
evade paying tax. That is not right
and we will not allow it,” the President
said after ordering that the goods be
released within three weeks.
The move to reduce the agencies
at the port would later be announced
by Treasury Cabinet Secretary Henry
Rotich in his budget speech in Parliament where he blamed the delays on
additional inspections of imports by
the Kenya Bureau of Standards and a



Kenya Ports Authority

containers at the port
of Mombasa. A new

State House directive

than 20 government
agencies from the port

host of other agencies once the goods
arrive in Kenya.
“To address this challenge, it has
been decided that once the Pre-Verification of Conformity (PVOC) has
been done at the point of export and
information relayed to our Customs
and Standards teams, the same goods
should not be subjected to further
inspection unless there is prior
intelligence on non-compliance. In
addition, Mr Speaker, the logistics at
the Port and at the Inland Container
Depot will be streamlined to have the
customs and the essential Standards
team only,” Mr Rotich said.
Another source within the affected
agencies in the changes said there
are bound to be “friendly fire” cases
among the agencies, with each trying
to prove its relevance while those
inside the port will be keen to keep
the monopoly of running the port
operations.
A major hurdle in this new directive,
our sources said, will be agencies
refusing to share crucial imports and
exports data.
The directive that all the agencies
must still deliver all their mandates
has even further complicated the port
operations with those whose access
is restricted complaining they are
likely to be victimised for mistakes
done by others.
“For the avoidance of doubt, it is
hereby clarified that all Government
Agencies with mandate over international trade operations shall continue
to remain accountable for the discharge of their respective mandates
in accordance with the existing legal
frameworks, but subject to adherence
with the guidelines provided in this
circular,” Mr Kinyua wrote.
So lucrative is the Mombasa port
that at least 27 agencies had established operations.
With the port of Mombasa now
clearing up to 1,000 containers in a
day, it remains to be seen how the
new changes will improve efficiency
while at the same time curbing the
potential loopholes that may hurt
both the businesses who pushed for
the changes and the consumers the
government have been seeking to
protect with such strict monitoring
of imports."

This carries the risk of exposure
to respiratory diseases.
Vehicles on Kenyan roads on
average each emit 180 grammes
of carbon dioxide per kilometre
(gCO2/km), considered too high
by the United Nations Environment Programme (Unep).
The Unep, headquartered in
Nairobi, recommends a lower
emission level of 158gCO2/km
for Kenya. Most Kenyans go for
pocket-friendly older second-hand
vehicles, as they can’t afford newer
set of wheels which pollute less.
Kenya has about 2.2 million
vehicles, 99 per cent of which
run on petrol and diesel. Matatu
Owners Association chairman
Samuel Kimutai says cautiously
that they’re still studying the
proposal’s viability.
“We want to see if it will bring
value to our current operational
model in terms of efficiency,
reliability and affordability,” said
Mr Kimutai when reached out for
comment. Last year, the number

matatu operators can save up to
80 per cent yearly in costs should
they switch to electric drive.
“Fuel is often the largest cost
factor followed by maintenance.
With an electric vehicle, there is
no fuel cost while maintenance
is less frequent” said Mr Gånge.
“The electric motor has only one
moving part in comparison to the
combustion engine that consists
of thousands. This means the risk
of something breaking down is
reduced significantly. And, since
the gearbox is also removed, costly

hat’s your typical matatu
like? A ramshackle jalopy

sadistic maniacs hurtling down
Tom Mboya Street on a weekday
rush-hour and billowing black
sooty smoke down its exhaust with
nary a care in the world?
To a group of five innovators
— four men and a woman — the
future matatu presents a far rosier
picture. Imagine a matatu whooshing by without the typical engine
noise, moving stealthily as if to
avoid being noticed. Curiously, it
has no exhaust pipe and, therefore,
no smoke is released.
This is the dream the group
is selling of a futuristic matatu.
Through their company, Opibus, Johanna Alander (the only
woman), Filip Lövström, Filip
Gardler, Mikael Gånge and Rawlings Nechevava (all Swedish)
want to convert petrol and diesel
matatus on Kenyan roads to electric vehicles beginning next year,
and Nairobi is first in the queue.
No surprises there.
The innovators told _Nation_ that
they were working closely with
Nairobi City County government,
along with the Matatu Owners
Association, to make the matatu
dream a reality.
The conversion will see diesel
and petrol engines removed from
minibuses and replaced with electric motors and battery packs. Also
to be removed is the fuel tank,
along with the gearbox, both of
which are rendered obsolete by the
electric drive. Instead of refilling
at petrol stations, the vehicles will
be recharged using solar power at
strategic locations.
The company’s selling point
is two-pronged: “To begin with,
electrified matatus are ecofriendly — zero smoke, zero carbon
emissions, and no engine noise.
Besides, since no fuel is used,
they promise a steep drop in fuel
and maintenance costs,” said
MrGånge. Aged 25, he doubles as
the sales manager.
Both new and second-hand
vehicles can be converted, including those with faulty engines and
gearboxes since such components
are removed anyway. Equally,
the technology allows room for
upgrades after the conversion,
including adding battery capacity.
Nairobi’s public transport system is shaky at best. Besides the
daily chaos and traffic, city commuters are forced to put up with
a cacophony of engine noise and

comes from China. Other smaller
electric parts are sourced from the
US. Opibus says it is yet to decide
on the price-point for the matatu
conversion.
The company, however, pointed
out that converted minibuses
stand to recoup their investment in
a year, to be followed by huge savings thereafter. Just slightly over
a year old, Opibus was founded
in Nairobi by the group of six, all
Swedish. By their own admission,
nearly all are university dropouts.
They forayed into Kenya at the
recommendation of one of the
co-founders, Filip, who had grown
up in the country as a boy with his
family. It wasn’t hard convincing
them given he had effortlessly
slipped into the fabric of Nairobi
life and felt the energy of the people, the promising tech ecosystem
and myriad opportunities, said
Mr Gånge.
The startup has built and
coached a local pool of young innovators drawn from disciplines as
diverse as engineering and design.
Its workforce currently stands at
25 mostly comprising locals. Plans
are afoot to double the number in
the next six months.
The company has since last
year been piloting the conversion
technology. Its initial focus was
on off-road vehicles for regular
and safari use, targeting off-grid
motor enthusiasts, travel agencies
and wildlife conservancies as well
as missions.
From their Nairobi workshop,
they have so far electrified safari
vehicles for Maasai Mara National
Game Reserve, Chyulu Hills National Park and Lewa Wilderness,
a wildlife sanctuary.
The models include Land
Cruiser HZJ 79 and Land Rover
Defender 90/110. The safari vehicle
conversion process typically takes
a week and costs between $30,000
(Sh3 million) and $35,000 (Sh3.5
million). The company says it



would in future cut the cost-range
with the scaling up of the business,
and achievement of economies of
scale. The electric vehicles can
run at speeds of over 120km/h.
They cover a minimum of 140km
before recharging with the smaller
battery and up to 350km with
larger batteries.
With only the sound of tyres
being heard, the silent drive of
an electric vehicle makes safari
expeditions a quiet experience,
says Mr Gånge. And besides not
leaving a carbon footprint in the
parks, the vans can move much
closer to wildlife, undetected,
giving tourists a delightful closer
view. The rumble of the traditional
diesel and petrol engines through
the wild often scares away shy
beasts.
“On the safari trail, guests
can enjoy the raw nature without a rumbling engine while for
park-rangers and surveillance
purposes, the silent electric units
can be optimal when, for example,
tracking poachers.”
Besides, the electric vans can
drive through shallow water
channels in the wild since the components in the electric drivetrain
are mounted in water proof boxes.
South Africa has a similar
company, Electric Safari Vehicles,
targeting wildlife sanctuaries and
games reserves with the electric
conversion business.
In March, during the One Planet
Summit in Nairobi, Opibus earned
accolades from the UN with the
deputy secretary-general Amina
Mohammed driving around Nairobi National Park on Opibus’
electricity-powered safari van.
Aside from vehicle conversion,
the company looks to pilot electric
motorcycles targeting boda boda
riders, which would be assembled
in Nairobi from next January. It’s
a similar approach taken by Ampersand in Kigali with its e-Moto
electric bikes.

_OKA leader preparing ground for exit_


_One of the OKA leaders has been meeting Deputy President_
_William Ruto and it is not clear whether the two have struck_
_a deal. In what could be a way of softening the ground, law-_
_makers allied to the principal have started attacking ODM_
_leader Raila Odinga in what could lay the ground for a pos-_
_sible exit. But others insist the principal is grandstanding_
_and waiting for a counter deal from ODM, a strategy which_
_can backfire as the former PM has plenty of alternatives_
_from the region. The rubber will hit the road in the coming_
_few weeks. Watch this space._


_Ruto’s Coast ally warms up to ODM_


_A leading ally of DP William Ruto from the Coast is soon alight-_
_ing from UDA bandwagon for Raila Odinga’s party, ODM. The_
_individual who has been a key cog of the DP’s campaign, fol-_
_lowing him to rallies across the country will be doing this for_
_self-preservation. It turns out that the county is one of ODM’s_
_strongholds and the UDA gospel has failed to sink in and so to_
_be elected, one has to align accordingly. Talk of Town has gath-_
_ered that the plan is to continue working with the DP after the_
_election. Already, the individual has had three meetings with_
_Mr Odinga’s handlers to undergo loyalty test. While the receiv-_
_ing party is sceptic about the move, there are those who feel_
_that in the absence of a stronger candidate for the gubernato-_
_rial seat, the politician may well fit the bill._


_MPs almost ruin Oburu event_


_The rivalry between two female politicians from Homa Bay_
_County played out on Friday afternoon outside United Ken-_
_ya Club during Oburu Oginga’s book launch. One of them is_
_said to have mobilised a political gang, loosely referred to as_
_“Men in Black” to teach her rival a lesson following long-run-_
_ning supremacy battles on county and party issues. Accord-_
_ing to our mole, it took cajoling, a little greasing of palms and_
_intervention from senior politicians to diffuse the situation_
_that threatened to add a shameful chapter to what was a_
_successful event attended by ODM leader Raila Odinga and_
_businessman SK Macharia among others. Party officials now_
_fear the rivalry, if not resolved, could soon turn deadly._


_Rivalry in Tangatanga grows ahead of rally_

_A top confidant of an MP in Kirinyaga has vowed to ensure_
_that some Tangatanga MPs will not speak in a meeting con-_
_vened by the Deputy President today. The man, known for_
_his generous handouts and aggressive politics, is annoyed_
_after a demonstration was held in the county in support of_
_the governor. The MPs targeted for the booing and being_
_chased away are loyal DP lieutenants and it will be interest-_
_ing to watch if the second-in-command will intervene to_
_save what will undoubtedly make or break his campaigns_
_in the county, known for high-octane politics._

_County officials boycott governors’ ball_


_Top officials from the 47 counties caused quite a stir when_
_they boycotted the governors’ ball accusing a senior coun-_
_cil official of arrogance and poor interpersonal skills. The_
_group, which included CECs and MCAs, had paid Sh20, 000_
_each as participation fee, but could not receive their badges_
_while those who did faced hostility from organisers as some_
_were blocked from enjoying lunch at the VIP tents. The low-_
_est point came when the official manhandled one of the CECs_
_and ordered him out of the dinner, forcing others to walk out_
_in solidarity. A first term governor from Ukambani, who wit-_
_nessed the spectacle, also walked out in protest and never re-_
_turned._


_Two clandes desert county executive_


_A CEC from one of the counties in the Rift Valley is leak-_
_ing his wounds after he was abandoned by two women he_
_had ferried to the Devolution conference hoping to have a_
_good time. The man had separately ferried the two wom-_
_en and booked them in two different hotels in Machakos_
_hoping to have a great and tiring three days of carousing. As_
_fate would have it, the two ladies got to know about it, forc-_
_ing them to run away as the man was still busy facilitating_
_his boss for the opening ceremony on Tuesday. Having in-_
_curred a great cost ferrying the mistresses, the man spent_
_the rest of the days in clubs of Machakos town._

_form of economic sabotage. “My only_

_cake and reach everyone, we are en-_
_tertaining retrogressive policies tar-_

_political expediency,” he said._
_Murang’a Senator Irungu Kang’ata,_
_however, said the reversal of the ICD_
_model was not a way to kill Nakuru’s_
_economy as there were other ways to_
_tap into its potential._
_“A ‘hustler’ government will estab-_

_Dr Kang’ata said most of those pro-_

_looting public coffers. He cited the_
_controversial lease of medical equip-_

_such a deal would be reversed and_

_Kimilili MP Didmus Barasa said the_
_DP was only targeting “luxurious pro-_
_jects” even though he did not say how_
_SGR, CBC and MES deals were in that_
_category._
_“Those expensive flagship pro-_
_grammes are the ones that increase_
_the tax burden to Kenyans. We will re-_
_vise the tax payable and zero rate es-_
_sential products to reduce the cost of_
_living. We’ll do away with luxurious_
_projects,” he said. The legislator said_
_reversing the CBC will involve fresh_
_public participation, adding, the cur-_
_rent regime has been using threats._
_“We bring all the stakeholders in_
_the education sector together, which_
_can be done within 100 days in offi ce_
_and engage them on how best to im-_

_On struggling sugar factories, the_
_DP said bailing them out had not im-_

_“We’ve put money in Mumias and_
_Nzoia sugar factories but we’ve not_
_succeeded in finding a solution for_
_the woes in the sector. As the govern-_
_ment of Kenya Kwanza,as our first_
_role in the fi rst 100 days, we will write_

_the balance sheet of Mumias and_
_Nzoia to zero,” DP Ruto said in Bun-_
_goma.“Where some of these debts be-_
_long to other companies, we’ll rene-_
_gotiate and the government will pay,”_
_he added._
_While in Kiminini, Trans Nzoia_
_County, recently, he said his adminis-_

A Standard

leaves Mombasa
port for Nairobi
container

terminal at

Embakasi on
March 29, 2018.



Mombasa railway station for 15 years as
from August 1, 2013. The matter is still
under arbitration.However, sources said
that some senior managers in KRC and
even in the Ministry of Transport believe
that the companies are linked to the Joho
family and hence saw a chance to deal
with them as one.
But in their letters of objection of
the terms and conditions, Autoport requested that issues to do with Portlink
be separated from Autoport because they
are two separate legal entities.
In January 2016, Kenya Revenue
Authority and the Kenya Ports Authority suspended Autoport and another
compa ny known as Portside Freight
Terminals Ltd over claims of engaging
in tax evasion and smuggling of goods
in to the country.
At the time, the Joho family did not
disown ownership of the two companies. Documents held by the registrar
of companies indicate that the three
companies indeed do have inter-linked
shareholders.
The directors of Autoport are listed
as Khamis Hamid Khamis and Hamid
Salim Sadru Salim, each owning 50 per
cent of the company which was registered on July 5, 2012.
Portlink’s directors are Fahmy Hamid
Khamis with 90 per cent shareholding
and Hafi fa Ali Joho with 10 per cent. The
company was registered on June 5, 2010.
Portside’s directors are listed as
Abubakar Ali Joho who owns 75 per
cent of the company and Hussein
Hamid Khamis who owns 25 per cent.
The company was registered on August
21, 2006.
We have established that fi ve of the
six directors are related, except Hamid
Salim Sadru Salim, who is said to be a
long time fi nancial adviser of Abubukar
“Abu” Joho.
Hafi fa is a sister to the Mombasa
Governor, while Khamis Hamid, Hussein
Hamid and Fahmy Hamid are his brothers. Abu is the force behind the family’s
sprawling business empire.
During his fi rst term, Mr Joho vehemently criticised the government’s
plan to develop dry ports in Nairobi
and Naivasha to handle the SGR cargo,
maintaining that it would k ill businesses
at the Coast. However, he has since
softened his stand since the March 9
handshake between President Kenyatta
and oppo sition leader Raila Odinga.
However, the manner in which it
got the NFT deal has raised eyebrows
among the senior management at KRC.
From email correspondences reviewed
by the _Sunday Nation_, it seems that
senior employees at KRC were not
fully in the picture about the Autoport
deal as they kept asking their seniors
for details and clarifi cations in order
to implement the contract.
Although the off er letter indicated
that the corporation was leasing
empty ground, the area offered is
also an operational area where there
are Rail Mounted Gantry cranes. This
means the corporation has eff ectively
conceded its operation areas and its
equipment to private persons.
In addition, the deal will also undermine the take-or-pay deal that KRC has
signed with KPA ensuring commitment
to have cargo from the port transported
on the railway line to guarantee its use
and revenues.
“Giving one player, or a few players,
exclusive rights to a national network is
courting disaster, the risk of industrial
failure if not systemic failures,” said our
Transport ministry source."

he past 20 years have been a journey of productive cooperation. The
Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) has bolstered high-level
〇〇〇

a leap in China-Africa relations from “a new type of partnership” to “a
comprehensive strategic and cooperative partnership”.
In 2015 and 2018, Chinese and African leaders convened two historic
FOCAC summits: one in Johannesburg and one in Beijing. In June this year,
the Extraordinary China-Africa Summit on Solidarity Against COVID-19 was
held at a critical moment in tackling the coronavirus.
In the joint congratulatory message to mark the 20th anniversary of
FOCAC, Chinese President Xi Jinping and Senegalese President Macky Sall,
the forum’s Chinese and African co-chairs, celebrated the moment of great
and unique significance with African countries.

**Common Development**
In 2019, trade between China and Africa hit $208.7 billion, and the total
Chinese FDI in Africa reached $49.1 billion, grown by 20-fold and 100-fold
respectively, over 20 years.
China has been Africa’s largest trading partner for 11 years in a row, and
has contributed more than 20 percent to Africa’s growth for a number of

years.
China has built for Africa over 6,000km of railways and the same mileage
of roads, nearly 20 ports, over 80 large-scale power plants, more than 130
medical facilities, 45 stadiums and 170 schools. These infrastructures have
made a big difference in Africa’s economic and social development.
The African Union (AU) Conference Centre, the Mombasa-Nairobi railway,
and the Maputo-Katembe Bridge, key projects in Africa’s drive to achieve the
“Century Dream”, stand as monumental symbols of the shared development
of China and Africa.

**People-to-People Exchange**
China has provided about 120,000 government scholarships to African
countries. Some 21,000 Chinese doctors and nurses in medical teams worked
in 48 African countries, treating about 220 million African patients. Forty-six
African countries set up 61 Confucius Institutes and 44 Confucius Classrooms.
Events across a diverse range of areas, including the China-Africa Youth
Festival, Think Tank Forum, Joint Research and Exchange Programme, Poverty
Reduction and Development Conference, the China-Africa Press Centre, the
China-Africa Institute, the China-Africa Media Cooperation Forum, etc., have
been successful.

**Fighting COVID-19**
The Council of Ministers of the AU endorsed China’s action in a communique
as a first important regional organisation representing a whole continent
standing out to support China at the beginning of the epidemic.
China has delivered more than 400 tons of critically needed medical
supplies to 53 African countries and the African Union, and dispatched public
health experts to 13 African countries. A total of 21 African countries have
signed medical supply procurement deals worth $54 million with China. The
Chinese government and the AU Commission have signed an agreement in
July for constructing the Africa CDC headquarters building in Addis Ababa.
China has already begun the process of vaccine cooperation with African
countries. As President Xi said, once the development and deployment of the
COVID-19 vaccine is completed in China, African countries will be among the
first to benefit from it.

China and Africa have jointly supported multilateralism, opposed
unilateralism and protectionism, safeguarded the international order and
system with the United Nations at the core, and promoted the Five Principles
of Peaceful Coexistence and other basic norms governing international
relations. Such collaboration has effectively upheld the shared interests
of developing countries as well as the overall interests of the whole
international community. Cooperation in peace and security is making
significant headway.

**Kenya Railways Transit Shed**
_The Kenya Railways Transit Shed is a temporary_
_storage facility approved by the Kenya Revenue_
_Authority. It was officially inaugurated by His_
_Excellency, the President on November 10, 2020._
_The shed, which is located within the CBD, was_
_developed following a directive by the Govern-_
_ment of Kenya (GoK) to set up a customs facility to_
_allow cargo deconsolidation for Micro, Small and_
_Medium Enterprises (MSME’s). The facility has the_
_capacity to handle up to 1,000 TEUS. It occupies_
_480 square metres of warehousing space, and has_
_adequate handling machines such as reach stack-_
_ers and forklifts._
_The launch of operations at the transit shed, also_
_referred to as the Boma Line, has decongested the_
_Nairobi Inland Container Depot, while bringing_
_services closer to the small-scale traders._
_In collaboration with approved freight consolida-_
_tors, MSMEs enjoy minimised shipping costs, faster_
_transit time and decreased wait time. The current_
_transit time, from the time the containers arrive_
_at the port of Mombasa to the transit shed, is 18_
_hours. Previously, importers had to wait for over_
_five (5) days for their shipment to be delivered. Due_
_to its proximity to the CBD, importers enjoy better_
_shipment scheduling, since the documentation_
_process is faster._
_Kenya Railways is responsible for all operations_
_within the facility, which include offloading of car-_
_go from the containers and customs shed storage_
_as well as temporary safe storage, while awaiting_
_administrative formalities such as customs clear-_

_ance._

**5. Inland Container Depot (ICD) Naivasha**
_The Inland Container Depot in Naivasha, also_
_served by rail, plays a key role in the clearance of_
_cargo and container handling and acts as the main_
_transshipment point between the SGR and road for_
_freight traffic that is destined for western Kenya_
_and beyond. The Naivasha ICD has improved the_
_efficiency of container mobilisation and eased the_
_pressure on ICD Nairobi, operations in Mombasa_
_seaport and Nairobi terminal. The Naivasha ICD has_
_also supplemented and reduced congestion along_
_Nairobi-Malaba highway._
_The Mombasa-Nairobi-Naivasha Standard Gauge_
_Railway facilitates transportation and related logis-_
_tical services for goods produced within the Special_
_Economic Zone and those on transit to nearby towns_
_and neighbouring countries, including freight des-_
_tined for Uganda, South Sudan, Democratic Repub-_
_lic of Congo, Rwanda and Burundi._


_**Key features of the ICD Naivasha include**_

- _**Access:**_ _The ICD is situated off the Kaplong-_
_Narok-Mai Mahiu (B3) Road on the Kenya Pipe-_
_line access road. It lies 15km from Mai Mahiu_

_town._

- _**Capacity:**_ _This 45,000 square-metre facility has_
_a capacity to handle over two (2) million tonnes_

_per annum._

- _**Infrastructure:**_ _Container Yard, Station Build-_
_ings and Station Yards, SGR loop lines (tracks)_
_within the ICD; access roads to the ICD; smart_
_gate mechanism; 24-hour surveillance and a_
_modern information technology platform where_
_importers and exporters will seamlessly clear_

_cargo._

- _**Increased Efficiency:**_ _The ICD operations in-_
_clude a one-stop centre for ease of operations_
_and efficient service delivery._

resident Uhuru Kenyatta yesterday revisited some of the
vexed matters affl icting the nation. Top among these are
〇〇〇

murder of women has also emerged as a threat to the family unit
and society that needs to be tackled urgently.
The war on corruption is now a tired line. So much has been
promised about it but with little outcomes. Unless the President
changes tack, it will remain a blight on his legacy.
A point that nevertheless resonated with the public is the
distaste for negative and divisive politics. It is revolting that the
country is permanently on an electioneering mode. Some politicians are perpetually crisscrossing the country campaigning for
top positions yet elections are still three years ahead.
Preoccupation with politicking undermines national development as energies are spent on vote canvassing and worse,
planting seeds of hatred and undermining eff orts towards creating
a cohesive society. While recognising rights of assembly, speech
and association, it must be pointed out that running around and
shouting at perceived enemies creates a toxic environment that,
if unchecked, could get worse as elections approach.
However, the President’s speech missed on key concern,
namely, the rising cost of living. He presented a rosy picture
of the economy, which does not refl ect the true position on the
ground. Government records state the economy grew by 6.3 per
cent last year, but the reality is that the cost of living is rising,
households are sinking into debt, businesses are collapsing and
unemployment soaring.
To appreciate this, one only needs to look at companies’ fi nancial results. In the past year, an inordinately large number of
companies listed on the stock exchange issued profi t warnings.
The implication of that is decreased revenues to the economy
and job losses. Since the government no longer employs, it is the
private and the informal sectors that hold the nation’s hope with
regard to job creation and when they crumble, the future is bleak.
Worse, the rising public debt is a major threat to the economy.
Granted, huge infrastructure projects, including the Standard
Gauge Railway, expansion of roads and electricity connectivityhave been rolled out, but their impact is yet to be felt.
The challenge for the government is to explore options for
growth. Reeling achievements of the past may be good for the
ear, but the challenge is in creating opportunities and providing
a conducive environment for businesses to thrive. After more
than fi ve decades of self-rule, the citizens deserve better.
〇〇〇


nspector-General of Police Hillary Mutyambai’s recent directive
increasing the categories of VIPs who should enjoy special
〇〇〇

an implicit admission of the glaring failure to properly control
traffi c. No wonder some MPs have accused the IG of overstepping
his mandate, saying he risks contravening the Traffi c Act. Only
the President, ambulances, the fi re brigade and police cars on
special missions are entitled to that privilege.
There is no question as to why ambulances and fi re engines
deserve traffi c clearance. The Head of State’s security is, of course,
paramount. As the holder of the topmost offi ce in the land, his
movement must never be hindered at any time. However, as
happens elsewhere in the world, there is a need for alternative
means to ease the President’s travel. Helicopters often come in
handy. If traffi c is frequently brought to a total standstill just to
allow the leader to pass, this badly inconveniences other citizens.
Including the Speakers of the Senate and the National Assembly, the Chief Justice, Attorney-General, Cabinet Secretaries, and
other offi cials will further compound the endemic traffi c mess
in Nairobi. It would, in fact, make more sense for more leaders
to experience what fellow Kenyans endure all the time so that
they can help fi nd solutions.
If leaders are truly the servants of the people, the increasing
propensity to reward themselves with preferential treatment
negates that very notion. The solution to the traffi c control
challenges is not to exempt the leaders from experiencing them.
This directive should be withdrawn, as it is bound to aggravate a
hopeless situation. Part of the long-term solution is the ongoing
construction of more roads and the expansion of existing ones.
Building subways would also help ease congestion.
There has been a rapid increase in the number of motor vehicles
on our roads. Economists estimate that the country loses Sh50
million daily in traffi c jams. This calls for strict and ingenious
ways to curb the wanton wastage of time and other resources.

I cannot conceive of a greater loss than the loss of one’s
self-respect.”
_Mahatma Gandhi_



sked by a BBC
interviewer how
〇〇〇

remembered, Nigerian Nobel
Laureate for Literature Wole
Soyinka responded that it was
not his problem. To Soyinka’s
mind, that was something for
those he would leave behind
after his death.
“Anything I do has nothing
to do with being remembered,”
Soyinka said. “I don’t think
along those lines.”
The interviewer wouldn’t
relent, and Soyinka’s response
was that the question did not
matter.
“Do you want me to tell you
how I will remember you?” the
interviewer persisted.
“No! No! No!” Soyinka
protested. ‘‘I’m not interested.’’
“I will remember you as an
eloquent, restless, wonderful
man whose ideologies
transcended the human
condition in so many shapes
and forms,” the interviewer
insisted, ‘‘but who was greatly
misunderstood.”
“I’ll settle for that,” a smiling
Soyinka conceded.
To Soyinka, living life was
not about obsessing on how
one will be deemed to have
lived, but more about one
living their best possible life,
and doing so the best way they
know how.
Of course there was a tinge
of modesty in Soyinka’s
nonchalance about the question
of remembrance.
The man knows that he
will certainly be remembered
as someone who strode the
African and global world of
letters, going as far as being
referred to as the conscience
of the nation for standing up



to various Nigerian military
dictatorships, including that of
Sani Abacha, which forced him
into exile.
On May 21, Kenyan prolifi c
writer and thinker, Kenneth
Binyavanga Wainaina, breathed
his last.
Binyavanga had spent close
to two months at the Aga Khan
University Hospital’s Intensive
Care Unit (ICU). Having
suff ered an initial stroke in
2011, Binyavanga got a second
hit in late 2015, from which he
didn’t fully recover. It has been
a more or less downward spiral
from that point onwards, until
his recent death.
Hailed as one of _Time_
magazine’s 100 Most
Infl uential People in the World
in 2014, Binyavanga became
one of the most recognisable
African writers when his
satirical essay, _How To write_
_About Africa,_ became the most
read piece ever published by
the UK’s _Granta_ magazine.
In the continent, Binyavanga
gained literary prominence in
2002 when he won the newly
introduced Caine Prize for
African Writing for his story
_Discovering Home,_ in which
he chronicles his journey to
Kisoro, his mother’s village
at the Uganda–Rwanda
border, from where he got his
maternal grandfather’s name,
Binyavanga.
His journey to Kisoro had
begun in South Africa, where
as intimated in his acclaimed
memoir, _One Day I Will Write_
_About This Place,_ he had fallen
out of status and was keeping
himself afl oat by working
as a journalist for the _Mail_
_&_ _Guardian,_ among other
publications.


〇〇〇
〇〇〇



Yet Binyavanga’s enduring
notoriety was that he spent a
proper chunk of the 10,000
(Sh1.3 million at current
exchange rates) Caine Prize
award money to fuel the
founding of _Kwani?_, the
subversive literary journal
which sought to redefi ne the
idea of literature in Kenya
and beyond, including by
publishing stories and poems
written in _Sheng._
As the journal’s founding
editor and unoffi cial
spokesman, Binyavanga
made himself enough
enemies, with the claim that
_Kwani?_ wanted to rid the
literary scene of gatekeepers,
most of whom dwelt in the
Literature departments of local
universities.
There would be endless
debates in the pages of







weekend newspapers as to
whether the _Kwani?_ philosophy
of breaking the gates and
letting in every Tom, Dick and
Harry into the literary holy of
hollies was an abomination,
and whether whatever the
journal was publishing could
even pass for literature.
But if anyone thought that
was the end of Binyavanga’s
controversies, then they were
dead wrong.
In January 2014, on his
birthday, the world woke up
to _I am a homosexual, Mum,_
a short essay Binyavanga
described as “the lost chapter”
of his memoir, in which piece
of writing he came out publicly
as being gay.
From that point onwards,
Binyavanga’s life’s work, and
all that it’s worth – especially to
those in Kenya and elsewhere
who are either opposed to
homosexuality, the idea of
speaking about it in public or
both – was reduced to ashes
since he was now perceived as
nothing more than a gay man.
Yet to those who saw his
coming out as a necessary act
of courage, Binyavanga became
a revered giant.
These two extremes, of love
and hate, emerged the moment
news of Binyavanga’s passing
was made public.
One, therefore, wonders, will
he be remembered as a Kenyan
cultural worker of note, or did
all that quickly go down the
drain the moment he brought
his sexuality into the picture?
Like Soyinka, Binyavanga
was probably not bothered
about remembrance, since that
is a question for others.

to create a monopoly — not at this time of liberalised market
and democratised social and political landscape.
It was unwise to decree that all cargo from the Mombasa be
ferried upcountry through SGR. To the proponents, the reasoning
was that since the government had spent heavily on putting up
the new rail network, and given the urgency to recoup the funds
and repay the exorbitant loans, the viable option was to force
importers to use the railway to ferry their goods.
But that is obsolete thinking. Swiftly, that directive precipitated
major losses to long-distance road transporters, who were pushed
out of business as SGR got preferential treatment. Concomitantly,
that triggered mass protests at the Coast with the transporters
vowing to fight for their fair right of business at the port.
The port is the lifeline of Mombasa. Besides being a big employer, it sustains a major base of logistics companies, which
contribute to the region’s economy, which fact cannot be swept
under the carpet. When, therefore, the local entrepreneurs took
to the streets to demand withdrawal of the directive, this was
easily boiling down to an economic protest threatening even the
security of the region. Indeed, matters were made worse by the
spin that the order was subtly designed to cripple Coast’s economy.
As a model, ferrying cargo via SGR and terminating at Syokimau in Nairobi is a major economic and logistical nightmare.
It amounts to double transaction — paying for hauling goods
to Nairobi using the rail and further for connection to onward
destination through the road. Time and resources are lost, demurrage costs rise and safety of goods cannot be guaranteed.
Delays and other inconveniences become the norm. All these
undermine business.
On its own, SGR is a tale of over-promise and poor delivery.
Conceived as part of an integrated transport system to accelerate
free movements of people and goods, SGR has unfortunately
been making huge losses and with the latest projections, it is
not coming out of the woods in the foreseeable future. Which is
the disappointing fact; that because it cannot make ends meet,
importers are compelled to use it.
Mombasa port is strategic for the region, serving several countries in East and Central Africa. But its continued comparative
advantage can only be guaranteed if its operations are liberalised
and investors assured that they have an even playing field.

〇〇〇


early 10 months since President Kenyatta ordered the
National Transport and Safety Authority (NTSA) off the
〇〇〇

police, there does not seem to have been significant improvement in road safety.
Indeed, NTSA data shows that road accident deaths have risen
in the past 12 months by 15 per cent from last year’s 2,021 with
2,326 people killed on the roads between January and October.
At this rate, the death toll could exceed the national average
of 3,000 people a year, mostly in road accidents that could have
been avoided, with more stringent enforcement of traffic rules
and regulations. The President had hoped that with the NTSA
concentrating on policymaking, the police would enhance monitoring and control to curb accidents.
One of the biggest headaches is the endemic corruption in the
police service that undermines efforts to make the roads safer.
But quite encouraging is the talk of collaboration between the
NTSA and the police in the latest crackdown on errant motorists.
Reports indicate that the Interior ministry has directed the NTSA
to join traffic police in the effort. The NTSA has denied this, but
some of its officials recently took part in impromptu checks on
motor vehicles along the Nyeri-Nairobi highway.
The real challenge has been the tendency to come up with ad
hoc measures in response to public outcries. But these knee-jerk
reactions just fizzle out, until another horrible crash occurs.
Efforts to curb the slaughter on our roads should be supported
regardless of the agencies involved. However, their roles should
be streamlined to avoid the duplication and wastage of resources.
The NTSA and traffic police are specialised agencies that need
to complement each other in the effort to make the roads safer.

enyans are outraged
that Ms Mariam
〇〇〇

slipped over the edge of a
malfunctioning ferry ramp
and disappeared into the
dark depths of the Likoni
Channel, with her four-yearold daughter Amanda Mutheu
on board, that no organised
rescue was attempted by the
Kenya Ferry Services, and that
the government is basically
helpless: The prospect of the
body being recovered is dim.
And no one will ever be held
to account for it.
This does not surprise me.
The reason why Kenya is still
a backward place is because
public servants, who are paid
by the taxpayer, are generally
not held to account for the
performance of their sector
or ministry or department.
There is no incentive for the
KFS to be mindful of the
lives of commuters. There
are no consequences for KFS
or the Transport ministry if
somebody falls overboard
from their faulty ferry. There
are no consequences either
if the government, as a
corpus, is unable to mount a
successful recovery operation
or screw up the courage to tell
the family — and the public
— that it does not have the
capacity to do it.
If the officials of a ministry
— from the Cabinet Secretary
to the relevant officers — were
punished for bad performance,
this country would be charging
ahead like a rocket.
Recently, we reported the
sad story of Telkom Kenya,
which is facing almost
certain collapse after MPs
called in the Ethics and Anti

〇〇〇
〇〇〇



Corruption Commission to
investigate the proposed
merger between it and Airtel.
These two firms have been
whipped by Safaricom and, if
they do not consolidate, who
knows whether they will last
until the end of the year?
MPs — possibly out of
an outsize sense of public
interest, if you believe in
miracles — wanted the
transaction investigated
because of a dilution of
government shareholding
in Telkom from 49 per cent
to 30 per cent sometimes in
2012. Telkom was then owned
by Orange. The business
required a cash injection, the
government would not cough
up, so the French put up the
money but took a larger stake.


**Suffers losses or collapses**
Orange has since sold its
stake to venture capital firm
Helios. When EACC moved in,
it stopped the Telkom-Airtel
deal and the work that was
being done on the transaction
by the regulators was put on
hold. The representative of
the shareholder is, of course,
the National Treasury, and
the experts to look at the
transaction should probably
have come from either there
or the Communications
Authority of Kenya (CA),
where the telecom experts
are. But in their wisdom, MPs
thought EACC was better
placed to probe the deal.
My argument is not that
the merger should not be
investigated — by all means,
if there is good reason to
investigate, go ahead and
investigate. The question
is: If Telkom suffers losses



or collapses as a diligent
policeman investigates what
happened almost seven
years ago, who takes the
responsibility for that loss?
Can the transaction that
took place those many years
ago be reversed? Should
my money be used to buy a
loss-making mobile phone
company? Hell, I’m already
a shareholder of a very
profitable phone company,
thank you very much.
Where is the public interest
in all this? It’s in protecting
the public shareholding in
Telkom. Does the merger
diminish or increase the
value of the public stake? It
increases and secures the
value of the public stake, in
my opinion. Telkom becomes
part of a bigger, more viable
enterprise. The public
interest is having a vibrant,
profitable telco with some
healthy competition. And
why can’t the transaction
go on amid investigations?
Neither the assets nor the
folks involved are likely to run
very far. Remedies can still be
enforced.
My knowledge of this
complex deal is limited.
But common sense tells
me that MPs ordering


〇〇〇





an investigation, without
clear probable cause, into
a private sector deal, and
have it conducted by good
people who may not have the
requisite expertise and whose
investigation is generally a
glorified fishing expedition, is
a bad idea. Few investors will
be willing to go anywhere near
a transaction that has even
the smell of the government
about it.
Anybody who has tried to
invest in this country will
tell you that’s the beginning
of your problems. You will
be shaken down by the
authorities; you have no right
to invest in this country unless
you have paid bribes. And you
can only own property so long
as a well-connected thief does
not want it. The minute the
thief wants it, the police, the
courts, Lands officials, brokers
and all manner of criminals
will form a coalition to ensure
that your wealth is stolen in
broad daylight. And none of
the officials paid to safeguard
you and your property will
ever be held to account.
There must be rules which
are strongly enforced on how
we go about stuff. Public
officials should not have the
discretion to interfere in
commerce in ways that lead
to losses to the public and to
investors. But most important
of all, officials must have a
strong incentive to ensure
positive outcomes in their
areas of jurisdiction and be
punished for failure, whether it
is sinking cars or multi-billionshilling transactions blocked
by endless investigations.

or the past two years, the government has invested heavily
in the administration of national examinations to restore
〇〇〇

of gross cheating in the exams to the extent that they nearly lost
meaning. Cartels literally sold exam papers to schools, parents
and students. Worse, they even sold grades to the highest bidder.
Many schools ceased to be centres of academic excellence —
teaching students to acquire knowledge — but converted to pipelines
for drilling learners to pass exams. It was not surprising, therefore,
that when cheating was curbed, many schools and candidates
found themselves at a loss. Not surprisingly, performance declined
drastically and, although there were contests that part of the reason
for it was that grades given were from raw marks, not moderated,
so to speak, the fact was, most candidates had not prepared well
and could not tackle the exams without cheating.
Then, as now, we warned that the culture of cheating had been
entrenched and that it would be hard to eliminate it altogether. Yesterday, the chairman of the Kenya National Examinations Council,
Prof George Magoha, issued an alert that fake exam papers were
in circulation and cautioned school principals, parents and candidates not to fall prey to the tricksters. Unfortunately, it transpires
that some head teachers have started collecting fees from parents
to buy those very dubious papers. Clearly, the cheating streak is
inherently embedded in the psyche of most schools.
But the bigger lesson here is that, one, there are schools, parents and candidates willing to do anything to get shortcuts in the
exams. The propensity to cheat is great and the onus, therefore, is
on the exam administrators to continuously review their systems
and structures to curb leakage. Two, fraudsters are on the prowl
and alive to the fact that there are many vulnerable people willing
to buy anything purported to be exam papers.
Notably, exam cheating is not restricted to schools; it has permeated through to universities, where students sought avenues
to get degrees without putting in any work. Which is why the war
against cheating must be extended throughout the education system.
Education Cabinet Secretary Amina Mohamed, together with
Prof Magoha, have given an assurance that more stringent rules
and regulations will be enforced to guard against cheating. But it
is noted that the cartels are still alive and kicking and scheming
day and night to circumvent the system. Eternal surveillance is
paramount. Those fraudsters selling fake papers, as well as their
clients, should be apprehended and charged for the crime.

two-week crackdown that has led to the expulsion of nearly
1,000 foreigners who have been working in the country ille## A gally is a laudable breakthrough. Indeed, the operation has

lifted the lid off a not-so-well-kept secret: The endemic corruption
in the issuance of work permits. As some wayward officials in the
Immigration Department have been lining their pockets, their
compatriots have been denied jobs that they deserve.
The effort to streamline the recruitment of expatriates is not
driven by xenophobia, as happens in some other countries. In fact,
Kenya has, over the years, been very welcoming to foreigners and
is among the countries hosting the largest number of refugees.
The only problem is the few crooked officials, who manipulate the
system for illicit gain.
Interior Cabinet Minister Fred Matiang’i has made it quite
clear that the aim of the crackdown is to ensure that only genuine
foreigners seeking to work in Kenya get work permits. And the
principle is that those recruited should possess skills that are
not available locally. From now on, foreigners will apply for work
permits in their countries and only come over after being cleared.
It is instructive that the swoop has been extended to net the
government officials abetting the scam. Some 30 officials have
already been sacked over the clearance of foreigners who pose a
security threat to national security. One loophole that needs to
be sealed is the use of tourist or other visas by criminals fleeing
justice in their countries, who then go into hiding in Kenya. There
have also been cases of terrorists coming in under camouflage.
The work permit criminal rings must be broken and the culprits
seized and punished. With the threat of terrorism hovering over
the country and the region, Immigration officials must strictly and
meticulous carry out their assignments to help secure the country.

y all indications, the
highlight of President
〇〇〇

to China this week will be the
signing of the Naivasha-Malaba
section of the standard gauge
railway (SGR).
I thought is an opportune
time to revisit this massive
project by placing it in
the context of one of the
most popular subjects in
contemporary development
literature — namely, China’s
debt diplomacy.
The Naivasha-Nairobi
section is also significant in
terms of the sheer size of the
project and its likely impact
on the country’s external
indebtedness.
But first, some background
and facts on the NaivashaMalaba section. This project
has been on the cards for
several years. As a matter
of fact, the related financial
contract has been under
negotiation since 2014.
A key aspect of this project
is that the route it will follow
was decided at a Cabinet
meeting on September 15,
2015. The Cabinet decided
that the line will run from
Naivasha to Narok, then
Bomet, Kisumu, Yala, Bumala
and eventually Malaba.
In addition, a new terminal
for the railway is to be built in
Kisumu consisting of a new
fully equipped, high-capacity
port, a passenger station and
a freight exchange centre. The
facility in Kisumu will cost the
country $140 million.
The Naivasha-Malaba
section of the SGR will
provide a reliable railway link
to the entire region through
Kampala in neighbouring



Uganda and on to Kigali in
Rwanda and Juba in South
Sudan.
The negotiated lump sum
contract price for the project
is a whopping $4.9 billion.
This is inclusive of civil
works, 29 locomotives for the
main line, four locomotives for
passenger services and two
others for shunting.
Clearly, this is going to
be the single-largest capital
expenditure project in the
history of Kenya.
With public debt now at
a level where we are now
spending 29 per cent of
revenues on debt servicing,
this project is bound to push
the country deeper into
indebtedness.
Today, as you look at trends
in Africa, and the developing
world in general, you will
observe that China cares little
whether the project they are
financing has commercial
short-term viability or not.
Unlike other lenders, the
Chinese do not bother about
whether cash flows from the
port or railway they have built
will generate enough revenue
to service the loan they have
lent you.


**Strategic national assets**
It seems to me that the
important considerations for
the Chinese are the following.
First, that the loan they are
giving you is collateralised
by strategically important
national assets — a port, a
railway such as the SGR or
national resources.
Secondly, that the project
enhances and fits in well with
their Belt and Road Initiative
(BRI).


〇〇〇




Under this initiative, the
Chinese are involved in
developing major trading and
transport corridors. Projects
such as the SGR will be
financed and supported in
pursuit of expanding the BRI
network.
We are at a point where we
cannot afford to take more
loans from China.
I say so because, these days,
the trend you see is that when
a country is not able to pay
back a Chinese loan, they just
sieze the hard infrastructure
assets they built for you, such
as ports and railways.
For example, when Sri
Lanka found itself in a
position where it could not
pay debts to China, the
country formally handed
over its strategically located







Hambantota port to the
Chinese.
The Chinese moved quickly
to seize the key port because
it is a link to major Indian
Ocean trade routes connecting
Europe, Africa and the Middle
East to Asia and, therefore,
sitting very well with the BRI.
China is also encouraging
its companies to bid for
outright purchase of strategic
ports.
Last year, a Chinese
company purchased the
Mediterranean port of Piraeus,
which will serve as the linking
node for the BRI in Europe.
Then there is the case of
Djibouti. Having found itself
saddled with Chinese debt, the
Horn of Africa country was
forced to lease strategically
positioned land to China.
In total, Kenya plans to
borrow a whopping $5.2
billion for development of the
Naivasha-Kisumu-Malaba SGR
section, the new Kisumu port
and the inland container depot
in Naivasha.
The cost of electrification of
the railway, which is estimated
at between 15 per cent and 20
per cent of the civil works, will
also be borrowed from China
Exim Bank.
If we do not tame our
appetite for Chinese debt,
we should not be surprised
in future if China seizes and
turns the port of Mombasa
— the gateway to East Africa
— into another Hambantota.
If, by bad luck, we are
unable to pay the loans, China
will be salivating to take
over the strategic national

resources.

That agreement became
part of the security package
for the loans Kenya borrowed.
This background explains
part of the reason for last
week’s major shake-up of the
top management of KPA.
It was suspected that
elements within KPA
had been colluding with
immensely influential owners
of container freight stations
to resist the arrangement
by channelling containers to
the private facilities while
circumventing the SGR.
Early last month, the
government directed that
all containers from the port
be ferried on SGR. But the
directive was met with a great

For the container freight
stations, the order meant loss
not only of business, but also
relevance. Their continued
existance was at stake.

— after the arrival of SGR —
had been taken over by KPA.

years, inclusive of a grace
period of five years. Second,
interest of six months of the
London Inter-Bank Offered
Rate (Libor) plus 360 basis
points. This comes to about
four per cent of principal.
Third, a management fee of
0.75 per cent payable up-front
plus a commitment fee of 0.75
per cent of the undisbursed
amount. Finally, insurance
from the China Export and
Credit Insurance Corporation
(Sinosure) at a premium of
6.93 per cent, payable in two
instalments.
Therefore, the all-inclusive
cost of servicing the Chinese
loans comes to an effective
interest rate of 12.5 per cent.
When they tell you that
Chinese loans are cheap,
they are engaged in utter
deception. The truth of the






agents also found themselves
staring at a bleak future.
But their argument was
not without merit. As long as
Kenya was still a free market,
they said, it was unfair for
the government to force
importers to transport cargo
on the SGR to the container
terminal in Nairobi.
As the management of KPA
dithered and procrastinated,
Transport and Infrastructure
Cabinet Secretary James
Macharia swung the axe.
He, in one fell swoop,
effected massive transfers of
top officers of KPA, arbitrarily
throwing long-serving staffers
to far-flung offices in different
parts of the country without
regard to whether there was
work for them or not.
We must now wait to see
how the move to give SGR a
monopoly of cargo from the
Mombasa Port will make the
company commercially viable.
And can the SGR service the
huge Chinese loans?
Mark you, at stake are
massive dollar loans.
Here are the highlights of
the loans Kenya borrowed
from China to build the SGR.
There was a commercial
loan of $1.633 billion and a
concessionary loan of $1.6
billion. These two were signed
and committed in May 2014.
Another $1.6 billion for the
Nairobi-Naivasha section of
the SGR was committed in
December 2015.
And we are in the middle
of negotiating $4.8 billion to
take the line from Naivasha to
Kisumu and on to Malaba.
What are the terms?
First, a fixed term of 15

have asked countless times in
this column before: Where will

being forced to regularly rush
to international markets to
borrow the dollars to repay
the principal and interest.
Which brings me to the
decision by the government
to force importers to use the
SGR. It is not right to do it by
fiat. Use soft power.
For instance, the
government could introduce
regulations on truck size,
weight and speed limits. It
could introduce regulations
on driver hours and emissions
and SGR-specific tariffs.
Trucking sustains a
lucrative underground market
for businesses dealing with
many things, including
contraband. And influential
segments of the political elite
have interests in trucking.
That is why I predict heavy
resistance to migration of
freight from road to rail.

he new house allowance secretly awarded to MPs cries out
for scrutiny and public debate. The MPs have become a
〇〇〇

Arguably, the allowance is illegal as it has not been approved
by the Salaries and Remuneration Commission (SRC). Yet, by
dint of the fact that they can paralyse government operations
by throwing out budgets and other Bills, they bulldoze their way
and get the Executive to acquiesce to their demands. What it all
shows is the propensity for the legislators to take advantage of
their vantage position to benefit themselves, notwithstanding
attendant illegalities and implication for the economy.
And this needs to be challenged. It is not fair that, any time
they so wish, MPs mobilise themselves and push through selfish
Bills to the chagrin of the helpless public. MPs rank among the
highest-paid lot. Although they argue, simplistically, that they
deserve that because they use their cash to support constituents,
that is a misnomer and, unfortunately, their own creation.
Institutionally, the government has created several kitties
targeting the various demographics such as women, youth, the
elderly and people with disabilities, as well as bursaries. The
Constituency Development Fund is under MPs’ control to use
in developing their areas. Also, there are various funds through
the county governments for grassroot development.
The catchphrase in government and private sector is cost-cutting and frugality. The National Treasury is confronted with a
huge budgetary deficit and has to seek alternatives. Just the other
day, it tabled budgetary estimates in Parliament indicating that
the government will have to borrow heavily to meets its financial
obligations. Already, the country is reeling under a heavy debt
burden and further increases are bound to worsen the situation.
On Labour Day, the government declined to increase the
minimum wage despite high expectations. Any attempt to raise
salaries was bound to be counter-intuitive; push up production
costs and diminish returns, both impactful to the economy.
All around, workers are going through a rough time because
employers cannot afford raises, given the current hard economic
times. Most organisations have frozen employment as others
resorting to job cuts to reduce expenditure.
MPs cannot justify the new allowance. It is unfortunate that
they continue to use their privileged position to enrich themselves,
making a nuisance of austerity measures put in place to cut public spending. We must find ways to tame this incessant greed.

outh Africans go to the polls today to elect their president
and lawmakers for the sixth time since the collapse of
〇〇〇

leadership to a lot they can believe in to carry their hopes and
aspirations and hopefully, fix the myriad sins of omission and
commission attributable to the successive past governments.
For the vast majority black South Africans, the post-Apartheid
era has been a dream betrayed. Not surprisingly, an estimated 25
million eligible young people failed to register for the election.
That two of South Africa’s presidents — Thabo Mbeki and
Jacob Zuma — had to terminate their reigns prematurely speaks
volumes about all that has gone wrong in the great Nelson
Mandela’s “Rainbow Nation”. However, it also gives hope that,
unlike in the rest of Sub-Saharan Africa, where presidents
evolve into demigods whose tenures can only be ended midway
through violence, its institutions in South Africa are functional
and independent.
Whereas Mbeki quit after a recall by the ruling African National
Congress (ANC) over alleged aloofness and indifference to the
plight of the citizens, Zuma became the quintessential dean of
the corrupt. He is faulted for presiding over the state capture
by corruption and is fighting a barrage of graft-related cases.
The past decade under the stewardship of Zuma was particularly
eventful in the rainbow nation. The country continued grappling
with widespread unemployment, unconscionable wealth gap
and feisty intercommunal and racial tensions and murderous
xenophobic frenzies targeting Sub-Saharan immigrants.
South Africa has since lost its position as Africa’s leading
economy to Nigeria, though it remains the most sophisticated
and modern. But today, South Africans have a chance to make
choices whose outcomes they will not regret.

ne of the big new
items coming out of
〇〇〇

President Uhuru Kenyatta
to China was the revelation
that the government is now
thinking about investing
money in the old metre gauge
railway.
I found my mind flashing
back to the messy experiment
we tried in 2006 when we
handed over the running
and management of the old
metre gauge railway line to
a concession owned by the
South African, Mr Roy Puffet.
I remembered how Mr
Puffet made a big fool of us by
making us believe that he had
the wherewithal — both capital
and management expertise —
to do a better job at running
the company than our homegrown managers, who had
been running it all along — the
likes of the late Julius Mimano,
an engineer I still regard to
have been the most successful
CEO of the company ever.
The first move Mr Puffet
made after moving in and
taking over as chairman
and chief executive of the
corporation was to commit
RVR Kenya to a management
agreement with Johannesburgbased shelf companies that
belonged to him.
That agreement allowed him
to repatriate (on a monthly
basis) millions of shillings to
the South Africa-based shelf
companies.
The contract also allowed
him to kick out our local
engineers and other staff
and to replace Kenyans with
hordes of South African
expatriates.
And, the agreement catered



management of a valuable
national asset to con men.
Mark you, the international
valuation company, Ecorys
Nederland BV, which was
contracted by the government
to specifically value the assets
in 2006 came up with a figure
of $808 million (about Sh80
billion).
And having run down
the asset for in excess of 15
years, without any substantial
investment on the permanent
way, on wagons, on
locomotives or on signalling
equipment and systems, isn’t
it just too late to start talking
about reviving the old metre
gauge railway line?
Experts will tell you that
the design of the metregauge, and its current state
of disrepair, limits it capacity
to deliver speed — rendering


〇〇〇
〇〇〇



for heavy management fees.
Under the contract, Mr
Puffet’s Johannesburg-based
shelf companies were entitled
to an amount equal to 2
per cent of gross aggregate
revenues of the company
as reflected in monthly
management accounts.
Thus, by tying fees to
revenues, Mr Puffet made sure
he was able to earn millions
from the company regardless
of whether or not RVR was
making profits.
After milking the company
dry, Mr Puffet sold the
concession to the Egyptian
private equity firm, Citadel
Capital, making millions from
investing nothing in Kenya
and Uganda.
The Egyptians who replaced
him were a bunch of smoothtalking investment bankers
who only came in to — like
vultures — circle the carcass
and wipe the railway assets we
had built for many years out of
existence.
The biggest single
investment they made in the
company was purchasing 20
locomotives.


**Forensic investigation**
A forensic investigation by
the World Bank’s Integrity
department showed that
the investment in the 20
locomotives was worthless.
On examination by local
engineers, the locomotives
turned out to be life-expired
and, therefore, not in working
order.
What is my point in
narrating the RVR concession
story? First, we must
accept that we made a fatal
mistake by handing over the







the line incapable of meeting
the future demand for railway
transport in both the country
and the region.
Indeed, when you look at
trends, such the rapid growth
of freight throughput from
the port of Mombasa, and
the rapid growth in import
volumes by regional users
of the port — countries
like Rwanda, South Sudan,
Ethiopia, Burundi, Northern
Tanzania and DRC — the
inescapable conclusion is
that it is in Kenya’s long-term
interest to keep the focus
extending the standard gauge
railway from Naivasha to
Kisumu and to Malaba.
I find the plan to extend to
Kisumu and build a new port
on Lake Victoria to make a
great deal of economic sense.
If it works, the Kisumu port
will become the beachhead for
regional traffic across Lake
Victoria, to Northern Tanzania
— and through River Kagera
to Rwanda.
More important, we
will have created a second
corridor, through the lake, into
East Africa.
That would be an alternative
route we can use just in
case Uganda decides to pull
another oil jetty move on us.
We can argue and debate
about expensive Chinese
loans. We can debate
economic viability of the
project.
But I have over the years
seen large infrastructure
investments criticised for
low economic viability, only
to later turn out to be very
successful in the long run.

arliament is on the spot once again over an extravagant trip
that cannot be justified in any way. This time round, Parliament
〇〇〇
blies plus a galaxy of other auxiliary staff for a conference in the US.
Attending conferences or international meetings is not a problem.
That is part of international collaboration, networking and experiential learning. But they must be justifiable.
In the first place, one cannot explain how a single country can
ferry such a huge delegation to an international conference where
participation is always limited to just a few.
What is it that the huge contingent is going to do? Countries are
only given a few speaking slots that require just a few representatives.
Even if they were to participate in side meetings, they are never
that many slots. Ideally and good manners so dictate, you only need
a small team, no more than five representatives to attend such conventions. Not a multitude plus unwieldy team of parliamentary staff.
Second, what are the benefits that the country will derive from
such a meeting? If it is presentations, a few can do. If it is learning
and knowledge transfer, just a few representatives would go and
prepare a report to share with the entire Parliament and for that
matter, the country at large.
Unfortunately, from past experience, delegates who attend those
international conferences hardly prepare reports and if they do, they
are so shoddily done that they do not help anybody. Largely, the
delegates are out for holiday-making and sight-seeing, not serving
the public interest. That is unacceptable.
Third and fundamentally, the country is reeling from tough economic times. Cost-cutting and austerity is the in-thing. Various arms
of government have had to cut their expenditures as the National
Treasury restructures spending to keep the economy afloat.
At present, there is a stalemate between the Senate and the National
Assembly over financial allocation to the counties on the premise
the Treasury is broke. Major capital development projects are being
shelved as the budget is being reorganised to release cash for priority expenditures. In the circumstance, it is patently injudicious and
imprudent for Parliament to engage in profligate spending.
Several foreign embassies in Nairobi have expressed disdain at
Kenyan politicians and top government officials’ obsession with
travelling to their countries under all manner of pretext, but which
visits never yield tangible benefits to Kenyans.
Speakers Justin Muturi and Ken Lusaka must do the honourable
thing and rationalise the trip. Only a few MPs should travel, if they
must, and on the condition they will submit a report to Parliament.
We must stop such largesse when everybody else is making sacrifices.
〇〇〇


he government’s indefinite suspension of a directive that had
required all cargo to and from Mombasa Port to be ferried on


truckers and clearing firms. It is a timely respite for those who
risked losing their jobs.
However, this is not the solution to the problem that has been simmering for several years. But it provides a chance for the authorities
and the industry to come up with a system that will accommodate all.
While the advent of the SGR has done quite well to ease passenger
train services between Nairobi and Mombasa, the same cannot be
said of its cargo transportation.
It had been expected to increase efficiency, reduce the time taken
from more than 10 hours to about five, and help to clear the trucks
menace on the highway. But this dream has remained elusive.
There are times when the owners of the goods cannot tell where
exactly their consignments are and continue to incur hefty demurrage charges.
These hitches inevitably push up the cost of doing business and
erode profit margins.
In a country that cherishes economic liberalisation, the various
entities compete freely. The SGR is a venture that is being implemented with hefty public loans that will eventually be shouldered
by taxpayers. Forcing the same taxpayers to use only these services,
denying choice exposes them to double jeopardy.
As Transport Cabinet Secretary James Macharia has been summoned by the National Assembly, this should provide an opportunity
to trash out the sticking issues.
The 800 trucks plying the Nairobi-Mombasa highway daily are a
huge investment and a source of jobs that must not be sacrificed to
create a monopoly for the SGR.
It should be left to compete freely without unfairly disadvantaging
its smaller competitors.

anzania authorities finally
produced investigative
〇〇〇

Erick Kabendera in court on
Monday and charged him with
a crime.
However, it was not the
crime everyone was expecting
they would slap on him. After
they grabbed him from his
home in Dar es Salaam on July
29, the police said they were
investigating Kabendera’s
citizenship status. On Monday,
however, they charged him with
money laundering, tax evasion,
and assisting an organised
crime racket.
Kabendera is easily the
brightest star in his generation
of journalists in Tanzania. But
that is no immunity.
Tanzania is a perilous place
for journalists (and civil society
activists, opposition politicians,
and even independent
researchers) since President
John Magufuli came to the
throne four years ago.
But it wasn’t paradise either
before that under Jakaya
Kikwete, Benjamin Mkapa, Ali
Hassan Mwinyi, or even “Saint”
Julius Nyerere who we and the
world still admire, and we feel
we are betraying Mother Africa
whenever we must point out his
many faults.
The difference is that
in those days, it was the
traditional media repression
and mistreatment of journalists:
A few slaps on the ears if at
all, a week in jail, a standard
charge of publishing false news
or sedition, and after a couple
of appearances in farcical court
sessions, the case would be
dropped, or a mild conviction
handed down.
In the last four years, the old
repression formbook has been
thrown away, and something



with hammers and tongs has
taken its place.
It was evidenced dramatically
in November 2017, when
journalist Azory Gwanda, who
was investigating mysterious
killings and disappearances
in his Rufiji region, went
missing. It was feared that he
had been “finished off” and
fed to crocodiles. Recently, the
government finally said he was
indeed dead.
Last year, when the New
York-headquartered Committee
to Protect Journalists Africa
programme coordinator Angela
Quintal (a South African
journalist) and sub-Saharan
Africa representative Muthoki
Mumo (a Kenyan journalist)
went to Tanzania to sniff
around, they were detained,
interrogated, and eventually
thrown out. In the past, they
would have just have bundled
nosy media freedom activists
on the next plane out and left it
at that.


**Fraudulent pastor**
However, in trying to frame
Kabendera as a “foreigner”
masquerading as a citizen,
the Magufuli government was
reading from a script that has
been standard for the ruling
Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM)
since Mwalimu Nyerere stepped
down in 1985. Nyerere was a
doctrinaire pan-Africanist and
had a very progressive view of
citizenship.
In 2001, the Tanzanian
government stripped the
then much younger, but no
less pesky, publisher, Jenerali
Ulimwengu, of his citizenship.
Strange, because they don’t
come more Tanzanian than
Ulimwengu, who had held
various government positions,
including being a Member



of Parliament, before going
into the annoying business of
journalism.
Of course, it is possible
that Ulimwengu, today also a
columnist for the Nation Media
Group regional publication
_The East African_, could have
walked off a ship docked in Dar
es Salaam port as a child and
wandered into the Tanzanian
bushes. But no, he was born on
April 4, 1948 in Ngara, in the
Kagera region of the country.
This tendency to label
strong-headed journalists
foreigners, is almost uniquely
Tanzanian in East Africa. There
is the occasional fraudulent
pastor, and some gold-chainwearing con man who will be
ousted in Kenyan as an “illegal
alien”, but you will never hear
of a person commonly thought
to be a citizen stripped of
citizenship. And most definitely
not a journalist.
In Yoweri Museveni’s
Uganda, the idea is anathema,
and in Rwanda it wouldn’t
be uttered. This even though







journalism is still a painful job
in these countries.
Nothing in Tanzania’s history
would have prepared anyone for
what happened to Ulimwengu
in 2001. At one point, Nyerere’s
Tanzania basically ruled that
Africans who had been living
in the country as refugees for
a certain period were citizens,
end of story. Tanzania led the
fight against apartheid and
Portuguese colonialism in
southern Africa. It was home to
thousands of South African and
Ugandan exiles, and liberation
movements.
It was the country where
tribalism went to die.
So, what happened? It’s
hard to say, and scholarship in
the years to come could shed
some light. However, the big
ideas that defined the Tanzania
of Nyerere, could also the
source of its current flashes of
xenophobia, and the tendency
to make critics stateless.
It seems there is still a limited
context for understanding
why an MP or journalist could
robustly point to state failings
and national frailties. In the
minds of the dyed-in-the-wool
CCM power class, for anyone
to fault the Great Tanzanian
Nation, it can only be because
they are “not one of us”.
Problem is that that Great
Tanzanian Nation no longer
exists. It changed — or even
died. The journalism of people
like Kabendera, ironically,
is driven partly by a need to
resurrect that glorious past.
They probably are the ones on
the right side of history.

he acquittal of self-styled televangelist James
Ng’ang’a in a death case exemplifies the capture
〇〇〇

by corruption. It is unbelievable that the investigators
could conduct such a shoddy inquiry and present
unconvincing evidence to a court that looked all too
unquestioning on an otherwise straightforward case.
Right from the time of the accident, when his car
ran over and killed a woman in Limuru, it was evident
that Pastor Ng’ang’a was going to escape easily. Police
officers investigating the matter were quick to falsify
evidence and even misled Inspector-General of Police
Joseph Boinnet. And the kind of police protection the
pastor was accorded pointed to a man with connections
in the upper echelons of the security system.
The whole circus played out during the trial and, with
what looked like an acquiescent court, the matter was
inevitably thrown out and the preacher left to go scot-free
for lack of evidence. Curiously, the presiding magistrate
was also transferred and, although that is purely administrative, the coincidence is unmistakable.
It is not by default that the investigations were bungled;
it was all well-orchestrated. And it is this recklessness
and casualness in handling serious legal matters that
spawned the public outrage that the case has elicited.
Yet this is not an isolated case; there are several others,
though they may not have received the same publicity as
this one. But they all depict the rot in the Judiciary, the
National Police Service and the Directorate of Criminal
Investigations. Such are the practices that demean and
create disillusionment in the justice system.
Fortunately, Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i
has asked the Director of Public Prosecution to appeal
the ruling — obviously in response to the public uproar.
This should be expedited.
Importantly, this should jolt the authorities into action.
Chief Justice David Maraga and Mr Boinnet must direct
internal investigations to determine how and why this
case was bungled and bring the culprits to book.
The courts and the police service should not be turned
into bases for laundering criminals.

ithin a month of his election as Ethiopia’s Prime
Minister, Dr Abiy Ahmed has made three signifi## W cant foreign trips: To Djibouti, Sudan and the

just-concluded two-day state visit to Kenya. The clear
message is a quest for closer ties and co-operation.
Top on the agenda is increased cross-border trade, the
fight against terrorism and developing infrastructure.
Kenya and Ethiopia are alive to the threat posed to
regional stability by Al-Shabaab terrorists in Somalia.
Indeed, both are involved in the regional military effort
to stabilise their common neighbour.
Investment in regional infrastructure is crucial; no
country can develop in isolation. The PM has pledged to
focus on the Lamu Port-South Sudan-Ethiopia Transport
(Lapsset) corridor. This includes a road linking Isiolo
in Kenya to Addis Ababa through the border town of
Moyale. The Ethiopians have completed their section.
Another area crying out for co-operation is electricity
supply with Ethiopia boosting hydro power generation.
But there is also a huge solar potential. In aviation,
Ethiopia has an enviable tradition. Co-operation through
marketing and exchange of expertise is a possibility.
But there are also socio-political challenges: Kenyans
in Ethiopian jails, rebel activity near the border and
the crackdown by Addis Ababa that has seen tens of
thousands of Ethiopians seek refuge in Kenya.

t seems to me that we
are gradually sinking
〇〇〇

the phenomenon described in
contemporary literature as the
Chinese debt-trap diplomacy.
The Chinese will readily
offer you infrastructure loans,
but you will only start feeling the pinch when the time
for servicing the debt comes
calling — and you realise that
your economy is not raising
enough dollars to repay it.
If you are in doubt that we
are gradually sinking into the
Chinese debt trap, just grab
a copy of the of the Budget
documents, which National
Treasury Cabinet Secretary
Henry Rotich tabled in Parliament last Wednesday.
The data from the National
Treasury reveals that loan
repayments to Chinese stateowned banks will nearly treble
soon when we will be required
to cough up a whopping Sh82
billion in debt repayment to
them in the year starting July
2019. In the current financial
year, the bill for debt service
to Chinese banks will be Sh26
billion.
When the Sri Lankans
found themselves in the middle of a China debt trap last
year, they handed over the
management of a key port to
the Chinese under a 99-year
lease agreement.
How I hope that we will
not get to the point when we
will have to surrender a key
asset to the Chinese as the Sri
Lankans did! Djibouti is also
about to cede control of a key
port to a Bejing-linked firm in
circumstances not too dissimilar. We have taken too many



The American conglomerate Betchel Construction and
Engineering plans to build
an express highway with four
lanes and 19 exchanges. Last
year, the company accomplished a major feat when it
managed to secure a commercial contract with the Kenya
National Highways Authority
(KeNHA).
However, it seems getting
the Treasury to sign a financial deal is becoming trickier.
From what I gather, support
for the project within key decision-making centres in the
government is beginning to
wane with its opponents arguing that Kenya does not have
space for more external loans.
The country, it is argued,
should instead go for a public-private partnership deal,



**ECONOMY**
〇〇〇



Chinese loans. While the huge
loans to finance the standard
gauge railway are what hit the
headlines, we have also borrowed heavily for projects of
little economic impact — such
as loans to procure equipment
for the National Youth Service
(NYS) and purchase drilling
materials — from China.
Going through the external debt register, you will
be surprised at the sheer
number and size of loans we
have taken for all manner of
projects — such as for buying
MRI equipment, procuring of
power materials, rehabilitation of technical institutes,
modernisation of Kenya Power’s distribution systems and
building Kenyatta University.
It is a reflection of the
power and influence the Chinese companies wield. Indeed,
Chinese contractors are more
adept at putting such deals together and in having financing
approved by the Treasury.


**Opaque agreements**
They have become adept at
colluding with Cabinet secretaries and heads of parastatals
into signing opaque commercial agreements that end
up saddling our external debt
register with expensive loans.
Just the other day, Head of
Public Service Joseph Kinyua
was forced to issue a circular
warning against the proliferation of these deals.
The Chinese will always
have their way — even when
others are told to wait. Just
look at the way the politics
around the proposed Mombasa-Nairobi expressway is
playing out.







where the private sector bears
most of the risk.
I have argued here before
that the project, as currently
conceived, has the potential of
worsening our debt situation.
But if you asked me, this is
not the real reason why it is
being resisted.
The reason behind the lacklustre political support for the
project is to be found in the
big influence of the Chinese
contractors and their powerful
backers in government.
One of the biggest construction companies in the
United States, with a global
turnover of $35 billion in
2016, Betchel’s entry into the
mega infrastructure space is a
prospect the Chinese are not
too willing to countenance.
If it flies, there will be major
implications for the Chinese
contractors, especially on
pricing of projects and the
quality of engineering.
Only occasionally bursting in the news, the struggle
behind doors between US
and Chinese for control and
influence over mega infrastructure deals is one of the
most intense ongoing political
struggles in Africa.
In March, during a tour of
Africa, then-United States
Secretary of State Rex Tillerson expressed the frustration
of the Americans when he
cautioned African countries
against taking too many Chinese loans. Mr Tillerson’s
view may have been self-serving but Kenya must not be left
to suffer the indignity of the
Sri Lankans.

_market demand for sandalwood_
_products is driving its poaching_
_in various parts of the country._
_It estimates global trade in san-_
_dal oil at around 5,000 to 6,000_
_tonnes annually, with Australia_
_producing 1,800 tonnes and In-_
_dia 400 tonnes._
_“Sandalwood’s importance in_
_traditional medicine, woodwork-_
_ing, Hindu and Buddhist rituals,_
_pharmaceuticals and perfumes_
_means there is ample demand,_
_allowing the few companies op-_
_erating in this sector to reap sub-_
_stantial profits,” Kefri chief exec-_
_utive Joshua Cheboiwo said._
_He added: “The haphazard_
_harvesting of sandalwood takes_
_place despite many people being_
_fined and jailed for their involve-_
_ment in the illegal trade.”_
_In Kenya sandalwood is found_
_in Baringo County in Marigat_
_sub-county and Chyulu Hills in_
_Kibwezi, Makueni County._
_Kefri, in collaboration with_
_Sandalwood Plantation Ltd, has_
_embarked on the commercial-_
_isation of sandalwood to save_
_it from extinction. So far, it has_
_raised over 6,000 seedlings of In-_
_dian sandalwood ready for tri-_
_als in the country. It has also es-_
_tablished seed stands of East Af-_
_rican sandalwood in Muguga, Ki-_
_tui, Kibwezi, and Laikipia and dis-_
_tributed over 6,000 seedlings to_
_farmers._
_“In 2021-2022 Kefri with part-_
_ners will plant over 10,000 seed-_
_lings of both East Africa and_
_Indian sandalwood trials in_
_Makueni, Kitui and Baringo_
_counties,” said Dr Cheboiwo._

Businesses have

dings in Mombasa City have

to attract or retain tenants.

_rime commercial build-_
_ings that were fetching_
_high rent in Mombasa City_
〇〇〇
_ty as tenants vacate due to lack_
_of business resulting from the_
_Covid-19 pandemic and change_
_of business model at the Port of_
_Mombasa._
_Famous buildings such as TSS,_
_Mombasa Trading Centre, NS-_
_SF, Electricity House, Bima Tow-_
_ers, Posta, Canon Towers and Bi-_
_ashara, which were once fully oc-_
_cupied, are now half or quarter_
_full._
_Moving around the city, it is_
_hard to pass by two buildings_
_without seeing a sign calling for_
_tenants, so much so that locals_
_are now referring to the tourist_
_town as the “To Let City” ._
_According to real estate play-_
_ers in the city, the pandemic has_
_changed business models, with_
_shipping and logistics firms_
_that were the nerve centre of_
_the city’s economic life shutting_
_their physical offices and con-_
_ducting their business online._
_Mombasa thrived on port busi-_
_ness, so the city suffered a major_
_blow following the introduction_
_of Standard Gauge Railway (SGR)_
_freight trains and clearing of car-_
_go at the Nairobi Inland Contain-_
_er Depot (ICD)._
_“Once cargo from the Momba-_
_sa port started being hauled di-_
_rectly to Nairobi ICD and the Na-_
_ivasha dry port, most of the logis-_
_tics companies that occupied_
_much of the commercial spac-_
_es shifted operations, leaving us_
_with no tenants,” said Tysons_
_Limited property manager Al-_
_fred Wambua._



_“Landlords have been forced to_
_reduce the rent to sustain and ac-_
_commodate the tenants whose_
_income continued to dwindle by_
_the day. Tenants have moved out,_
_others relocated to more pock-_
_et-friendly buildings,” said Mr_
_Wambua._
_He added that the pandemic_
_was like the last nail on the cof-_
_fin that saw the businesses in the_
_tourism hub collapse._
_“We have tried to lower rent_
_and give waivers to tenants but_
_this too has not born much fruit._
_Mombasa lost it after the opera-_
_tionalisation of the SGR freight_
_trains,” he said._
_Mr Elius Maganga of Idime_
_Property Management reiter-_
_ated the fact that the shifting of_
_businesses, especially the logis-_
_tics companies, and Covid-19_
_have adversely affected the_
_county’s economy._
_He noted that downward rent_
_adjustments by agents in the city_
_ranged between 2 and 10 per_
_cent, depending on the property_
_and its location, but it was most-_
_ly in vain._
_Solian Limited sales manag-_
_er Brian Kosgei noted that the_
_commercial space in Mombasa_
_is undergoing dynamic changes._
_Because of the pandemic, most_
_businesses are trying to lower_
_their operating costs._



_“Renting space has become un-_
_attractive. People are current-_
_ly moving to shared workspac-_
_es. Some companies share the_
_boardroom and reception, then_
_they partition other spaces for_
_the respective companies in or-_
_der to share costs. It is becom-_
_ing the norm. We have a few ser-_
_viced apartments and people_
_are renting them for weeks, or_
_months,” Mr Kosgei explained._
_He noted that most businesses,_
_with the onset of the pandemic,_

_has been at 30 per cent for the_
_last four years. The facility was_
_meant to be a high-end proper-_
_ty, the place remains ‘empty’ de-_
_spite it being at a strategic loca-_
_tion, opposite Nyali Centre,” Mr_
_Kosgei said._
_Mr Kosgei added that Momba-_
_sa’s only hope lies in changes in_
_policies to make the county at-_
_tractive for commercial space_
_once again._
_Landlords called on the na-_
_tional government to mar-_
_ket Mombasa destinations_
_and promote domestic tour-_
_ism to spur a revival of the city_
_and therefore its businesses._
_Mr Lovetone Mwongellah, a re-_
_al estate consultant from Bam-_
_buri said some commercial_
_buildings in Nyali are at 50 per_
_cent occupancy unlike in Nai-_
_robi where spaces are hot cake._
_“We are optimistic the road in-_

_revive the economy of Mom-_
_basa, and different projects_
_such as the Dongo Kundu Spe-_
_cial Economic zone will re-_
_vive the manufacturing in-_
_dustry,” said Mr Mwongellah._
_Residential estates in areas such_
_as Changamwe and Mikindani_
_have not been spared the deser-_
_tion, with landlords being forced_
_to cut rents by almost half._
_“For a three-bedroom house_
_in Mikindani, we used to charge_
_Sh25,000, but now we can rent_
_even at Sh15,000. We have to do_
_so instead of leaving the house_

_“Prison visits were curtailed as_

_The State Law Office has successfully intervened_
_in a case that would have seen Kajiado County pay_
_Sh400 million in compensation to a hotelier at the_
_Amboseli National Park._
_Amboseli Safari Club had sued the defunct_
_Olkejuado County Council in 2004, accusing it of_
_breaching a lease agreement for 70 acres._
_A section of the lease agreement between the ho-_
_tel and the county council provided that the lat-_
_ter would not offer a similar lease to a rival facility_
_within a certain radius._
_However, Olkejuado County Council officials_
_led by then chairman Tarayia Ole Kores alleged-_
_ly breached the deal, allowing Ol Tukai Lodge to_
_be set up in the area, sparking a titanic legal battle._
_In 2009, an arbitrator, Mr John Ohaga, award-_
_ed the hotel Sh360 million in general and special_
_damages. The hotel was to also pay the county gov-_
_ernment Sh40 million in rent arrears._
_Governor Joseph ole Lenku this year dispatched_
_County Attorney Augustine Sekeyian and Finance_
_executive Alais Kisota to join Solicitor-General Ken_
_Ogeto, ending in the successful high-level negoti-_
_ations._
_Yesterday, Governor Lenku said it was a relief_
_that the county government would not lose colos-_
_sal amounts of money due to the impunity perpe-_



_time and,in most cases, his [Chavan-_
_gi’s] role was usurped and authority_
_overlooked._
_The committee was shocked that in_
_some cases, NLC had to send valuers_
_to confirm details of acquired land._
_Equally confounding was the au-_
_dit’s disclosure that NLC paid land-_
_owners based on valuation schedules_
_that were either not dated, not signed_
_or not made available, meaning, pay-_
_ments were made without evidence_
_of valuation reports._


**Undated and unsigned**

_Ms Tache told the House team that_
_the valuation reports the commis-_
_sion handed to the Auditor-General_
_were undated and unsigned. She said_
_she has since directed the acting direc-_
_tor of valuation to ensure all the valu-_
_ation reports are handed over to her_
_before any payment is made._

he government’s directive on the use of Naivasha inland
port for transit goods has sparked debate in recent weeks
〇〇〇

regional trade. Several issues have come to the fore. At the core
is the question of viability and cost-effectiveness of the transit
port. Equally, concerns have been expressed regarding the quality
and adequacy of facilities at the Naivasha port.
The rationale for Naivasha inland port is that it provides an
easy and direct transportation of goods from Mombasa through
the Standard Gauge Railway. It eases congestion at the Mombasa
port and expedites the turnaround time of freight movement.
Moreover, it is part of the Northern Corridor transport system
that is collectively being promoted by EAC Heads of State. To
be sure, the resolution to use Naivasha inland port was ratified
at a recent meeting of regional Presidents last month.
Notwithstanding the political agreements canvassed at the
highest level, there are serious practical issues that have to be
addressed. Uganda, which is among the top users of Mombasa
port, has twice written to Kenya in recent weeks to express
objection to the use of Naivasha port on the grounds that it will
raise freight costs and consequently increase the cost of doing
business. Which raises the question of whether the countries are
really committed to the relocation or only do that for political
convenience but have other considerations.
Cargo handlers, clearing and forwarding agents, traders and
those in the logistics chain based in Mombasa have vocally opposed the move and on several occasions and mounted protests
to express their rejection. For them, the transition is a straight
loss of business. And that affects a long chain of other players.
This week, Infrastructure Cabinet Secretary James Macharia
sought to clarify the issues as he met MPs, explaining that he
was simply executing a directive by the Heads of State. Moreover,
he indicated that the directive was part of the strategies to avert
Covid-19 infections by easing congestion at the Mombasa port.
Right from the start, it is acknowledged that Mombasa port,
which has served the region for years, is riddled with many
challenges, some historical, technical and political, but which
collectively have undermined its capacity to offer effective service.
Which makes it necessary to explore other options.
However, pertinent issues have been raised which Mr Macharia and his team have to address. When key stakeholders raise
issues, they deserve a hearing. Relocation to Naivasha inland
port should be properly thought through.

ne of the most unpopular proposals in this year's budget
is the decision to remove the tax exemptions for retirees.
〇〇〇

to lose as the taxman pursues them in retirement, are up in arms
and do not have any kind words for Treasury Cabinet Secretary
Ukur Yatani. He is, of course, the one who unveiled the measures
that see the retirees aged 65 and above get reduced dues should
Parliament approve the proposal.
Granted, the government must raise revenue to plug its huge
budget deficits. However, these are difficult times, what with the
devastation caused by the coronavirus pandemic. The retirees
see this as a scheme to make their lives more miserable despite
having sacrificed a lot. While in employment, they paid taxes
and something was put aside to tidy them up during retirement,
but it is what the taxman now wants snatch from them. In other
words, the retirees feel that this move amounts to double taxation.
Mr Yatani has reintroduced proposal MPs rejected in the Tax
Amendment Act passed in April to cushion businesses and workers
against the dire effects of Covid-19. Should the MPs endorse it,
the retirees will pay at least 10 per cent on their monthly pension
of Sh33,333 or 25 per cent for amounts higher than Sh100,000.
While paying taxes is a civic responsibility, it should be fair.
This is a group that is faced by old-age diseases with substantive
spending on medical care. After leaving employment, the retirees
must find alternatives medical schemes. It is understandable
that the senior citizens have condemned this as robbery by money-hungry government. Raiding the retirees' pensions could only
be justified as a last resort after the wanton wastage in public
spending and tax evasion are curbed.

“Understanding Covid-19”
webinar series, and this week I
was involved in one of them.
The main principal, to use a
word much beloved in Kenyan
politics, was Ms Winnie
Byanyima, the executive
director of the Geneva-based
United Nations Programme on
HIV and Aids (UNAids) and,
until last year when she left to
take the job, executive director
of Oxfam International.
In the two years before that,
she was based in Nairobi after
Oxfam moved its headquarters
to the Green City in the Sun.
You never know the juicy
bits that will be thrown out
there in these things. There
were quite a few. Speaking on
the challenge the Covid-19
pandemic poses to healthcare
systems in Africa, Byanyima
cited the case of South Sudan.
She said a colleague had
illustrated South Sudan’s dire
straits with the example that
it had more vice-presidents

[five] than ventilators [four]
to support people critically ill
with the coronavirus. Notably,
three out of South Sudan’s
five VPs, 10 Cabinet members
and all but one of the nowdisbanded High-Level Task
Force on Coronavirus have
tested positive for the virus.
A few days ago, Burundi’s
outgoing president Pierre
Nkurunziza suddenly died
(may his soul rest in peace),
officially of a heart attack.
However, his wife Denise
Bucumi had been admitted to
Aga Khan Hospital, Nairobi,
with coronavirus, at the end
of May. A medical document



seen by AFP, the news agency
reported, said she had tested
positive for the virus and
suffered “respiratory distress”.
It continued: “A medical
source at the Karusi hospital,
where Nkurunziza died, told
AFP he had also been in
‘respiratory distress’ before
his death.
“A medical source at the
Kamenge university hospital
in Bujumbura told AFP that
the head of the institute
of public health ‘came to
requisition our hospital’s only
ventilator’. Both were flown
to the hospital in Karusi but
it was ‘too late; President
Nkurunziza was already dead’.”
The image of a sole
ventilator being flown around
the country to save a dear
leader’s life is quite dramatic
but it speaks to the old wider
problem, as Byanyima said,
about where the priorities of
our governments lie.


**More generals than doctors**
A report last month by The
Sentry, an organisation that,
according to its description
of itself, is an “investigative
and policy team that follows
the dirty money connected
to African war criminals and
transnational war profiteers”,
drew an eye-popping contrast
about the state of South
Sudan’s health system. It
said South Sudan had more
military generals than doctors.
With 700 military figures with
the rank of general, nationally,
that’s about three times as
many generals as physicians.
This disproportionate
allocation of national
resources to the men in arms,
and politicians, is always an



indicator about where the
power the State and president
need to survive lies. In South
Sudan, the leaders of the
myriad militias are co-opted
by the ruling Sudan People’s
Movement/Army to keep
the peace and buy support.
Nothing less than brigadiergeneral, major-general or
general and a fleet of fourwheel-drive cars will do. Rebel
chiefs can’t drive ventilators.
Sometimes this allocation
can be extreme. When Charles
Taylor became Liberia’s
president in 1997 after the
civil war, for most of the early
years he was in power, before
he resigned in 2003 and was
eventually led off in handcuffs
to be tried for war crimes, the
street on which he lived was
the only one with piped water,
electricity and street lights in

the ruined capital Monrovia.
Oliver Kobusingye is a
Ugandan writer and medical
doctor. She doesn’t suffer
fools gladly and takes life
seriously. Last month, she
wrote a guest blog for _Oxfam_
_Blogs_ . Noting that Uganda
had got a couple of things
right in its Covid-19 fight,
she bemoaned some of the
government’s, and President
Yoweri Museveni’s, ‘SouthSudanesque’ tendencies.
Uganda has one of
the largest government
administrations per
population, she wrote. “For
its 41 million people, the
country has 80 ministers, 426
Members of Parliament, more
than 400 salaried presidential
advisors.” The president has
five times more advisers than
cabinet ministers, and nearly
equal to the number of MPs.
If, in this social-distancing
age, they all had to come to
meet him, it would require
about 15 buses to ferry them.
As the pandemic built up,
Parliament held an emergency
session and passed a
supplementary budget; “a tidy
sum of €600 million (Sh72
billion) was to be borrowed
from the European Union…
and the Legislature obliged.
Then the splitting of the
money began. “First off, €100
million went to the President’s
household as classified
expenditure,” she wrote.
In our neck of the woods,
it’s not the patient dog that
gets the fattest bone. It goes
to the most ferocious one.

he handshake between President Uhuru Kenyatta and
opposition leader Raila Odinga has singularly attracted
〇〇〇

two erstwhile political rivals entered a truce in March last
year after two calamitous presidential elections in 2017,
beyond ending vicious confl icts and violence, details of the
rapprochement remain a guarded secret. The only manifest
and public outcome is the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI),
which has since gone round the country collecting and
collating views from the public on governance and stability.
It is this mystique around the covenant between the two leaders
that has elicited cynicism and scepticism, with the less charitable
viewing it as a pact of scions of Kenya’s Independence leaders,
but nothing to do with citizens. Speaking in Suswa, Narok, this
week, President Kenyatta took exception to BBI’s critics, condemning them for speculations about the initiative. Specifi cally,
he is agitated that some pessimists purport that the BBI is a ploy
to change the Constitution and create a position for him after
his second presidential term ends in 2022. For good measure,
he declared that he is not interested in any job and would exit
when the time comes. That is reassuring and serves to debunk
the lies being peddled by some conspiracy theorists.
Even so, President Kenyatta and his newfound friend Mr Odinga
have to be ready to take the fl ak because they have failed to explain to Kenyans what the handshake is all about. Speculators
have coined all sorts of explanations and wove self-gratifying
narratives around the whole thing. For example, some Odinga
loyalists have interpreted the deal as a ticket for them to enter
government and resorted to behaving as state functionaries.
Conversely, some Jubilee politicians see it as a ploy to throw
them out of the party and consequently taken to fi ghting the
government from within. That is the danger of information dearth.
There must be something far deeper in the accord. Ending
the post-election chaos was critical but temporal. Even though
it has worked, the country needs a well-grounded formula that
guarantees lasting peace. That elections should not be the genesis of violence. Whenever opinions confl ict, there are civilised
ways of resolving them.
But the destiny of an entire nation ought not to be left in the
hands of two individuals. President Kenyatta and Mr Odinga
have an obligation to explain to the public what their agreement
is all about.

〇〇〇


The threat by sports federations to hold demonstrations to
compel the government to support national teams indicates the
mess in the management of games. Football Kenya Federation
(FKF), Athletics Kenya, Kenya Hockey Union (KHU), Kenya
Table Tennis Association and Kenya Rugby Union (KRU) argue
that their national teams are suff ering neglect and attempts to
resolve vexing matters have proved futile.
FKF, for example, says it has not received any funding, other
than some Sh240 million for the national team’s preparation and
participation in the Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon). Harambee
Stars are gearing for the 2021 Afcon qualifi er while Harambee
Starlets are going on with their 2020 Tokyo Olympics qualifi ers.
KHU only received air tickets for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics
qualifi ers campaign three months ago in South Africa, but the
players have not been paid their allowances.
KRU has not received any support for Kenya Simbas’ qualifi er
last year for the ongoing Rugby World Cup, Under-20 team’s
Chipu campaign at Africa Under-20 and World Junior Trophy
in Argentina. The women’s rugby team, Kenya Lionesses, have
gone through three major events without any support.
The preparations for the World Under-20 Championships in
athletics are alarmingly slow, with no mechanism for identifying
athletes to compete at the event.
The Sports ministry has to resolve the affl ictions of the federations. The Sports Act enjoins the government to fund national
teams. A Sports Fund was formed to cater for that but it appears
there is duplication of roles between the Sports Fund and Sport
Kenya. This has to be resolved urgently, but the federations must
also follow the right channels while seeking funds.

omorrow, Kenyans will
mark the fi fth Mashujaa
〇〇〇

the pomp and circumstance
that such a day deserves. It
is, indeed, a great day when
we remember those heroes
and heroines who fought for
our Independence, sometimes
sacrifi cing their lives for
freedom.
A great deal will be written
and broadcast about the day
and it is a given that someone
will analyse who is a true hero
and who is fake.
It is also expected that our
world-conquering athletes,
Eliud Kipchoge and Brigid
Kosgei, will be honoured
for fi rmly placing Kenya on
the global map with their
incredible performances.
We, indeed, should have a
great deal to celebrate about.
But there is a huge, hairy,
and distinctly unsightly fl y
in the ointment that makes
all such celebrations null.
Our country has become
dysfunctional in many ways.
We still do not seem to have
any idea how to fi ght and win
the war on corruption. True,
we acknowledge that the team
leading the eff ort is making
all the right moves. However,
there is a loophole that allows
the thieves to enjoy their loot
for years on end without much
hindrance.
Our healthcare system is in
a shambles, and our county
governments never admit
the fact and let go so that the
national government can take
over. Beyond that, of late,
there seems to be a rise in the
number of police offi cers who
have gone rogue; they have
become predators and many



Kenyans do not know who to
turn to for protection.
There is no shortage of stuff
to lament about, but to me the
most egregious failure is that
56 years after Independence,
we still cannot feed ourselves.
Our farmers are still using
20th century methods even
as land sizes dwindle, making
any eff ort to grow either cash
or food crops futile.
At the same time, Kenyans
are multiplying at a furious
pace and the old ones
dying and being buried in
overcrowded plots. As a result,
this country is in danger
of turning into a net food
importer, yet we have enough
land for all our needs.
It is said that this country
has the sixth highest number
of poor people in the world,
but you cannot tell it from the
number of fl ashy juggernauts
that ply our roads. This means
that most of the wealth is in
the hands of a few. Whether
they made the money legally is
another issue altogether. What
is incontestable is that the gap
between the very wealthy and
very poor is getting obscenely
wider with each passing day.
Land size is not the only
problem with the way we
practise our agriculture. Many
ideas have been fronted on
how we can increase yields,
but some of them tend to be in
the realm of fantasy. I recently
came across a write-up that
called for land consolidation.
According to the writer, the
government would lease land
from large owners and grow
crops. How this would work is
diffi cult to fathom.
Even countries like China
and the former Soviet



Union that tried forced
collectivisation during their
revolutions fl opped badly.
Land consolidation is not
for us unless done voluntarily;
individual land ownership is
everything in our unabashedly
capitalist society. To echo
President Uhuru Kenyatta,
“no nation can claim to be
developed without having a
secure, aff ordable and easily
accessible food supply”.
Indeed, and in those terms
alone, Kenyans have a long
way to go. Instead, we keep
bragging about development
just because we have a
hideously overpriced standard
gauge railway and a few other
white elephants roaming our
economic landscape.


        - * *
The peccadillos of members







of county assemblies are fast
becoming my favourite topics.
Perhaps the explanation
could be that they are
largely anonymous, yet they
wield enormous but largely
unappreciated power. They
have even found a way to
steal from us without getting
caught, joining the club of
rulers who have absolutely
no compunction about such
shenanigans.
However, a few do come
up with brilliant ideas, which
are, unfortunately, rarely ever
thought through before being
fl oated.
Take, for instance, the
idea of making motorists in
Nairobi pay for parking space
by the hour. Not only would
the city government collect
more revenue, the MCAs
argue, those who do not plan
on spending hours in the city
would not have to pay the
whole fee. Unfortunately, it is
diffi cult to see how such an
arrangement can work. Not
only would it be a logistical
nightmare, it would make the
city even more chaotic.
The county legislators
should not be merely thinking
of how to collect more from
hapless motorists by doubling
the parking charges. The
idea should be to decongest
Nairobi by limiting the
number of private vehicles
entering it. If a motorist does
intend to park in the city
streets, then he or she should
be prepared to pay through
the nose. This works well in
cities whose populations are
fi ve times larger than ours.

hen the Maai Mahiu-Narok road cracked a week
ago, for the second time in recent times, the
〇〇〇

jobs. But hardly a few days later, the road developed
a fresh and wider crack, which this time extended for
kilometres away from the highway, raising serious
questions about the region’s ecological balance.
As we reported in yesterday’s edition, the spontaneous
cracks on the highway underline a far deeper geoecological phenomenon that requires deep and expert
analysis. It is emerging that the region, right on the
Rift Valley bed, is going through tectonic shifts whose
cumulative impact cannot be ascertained as yet.
Apparently, there have been earth movements that
have caused crevices on the ground, adversely affecting
infrastructure and, for that matter, human settlement
and agriculture. This is a matter that should worry us
all. Our ground may be shifting — literally — but we
remain clueless and, therefore, exposed to adversities
that we might not be able to deal with.
Geologists postulate that the Rift Valley was a
consequence of tectonic changes millions of years ago,
which process seems not to have ended.
The sporadic eruption of some volcanic mountains
along the Great Rift Valley — which extends from the
Red Sea right through Kenya to Mozambique, on one
side, and through Uganda to Botswana, on the other
— is a manifestation of the fact that the explosive
underground activities are still continuing and with
potentially dangerous outcomes.
This is why geologists are warning that, as happened
some 25-30 million years ago, when Africa broke away
from Eurasia at the Arabian Peninsula, similar rifts could
be in the offing. What we have seen may just be the tip
of the iceberg, and, therefore, we need more research
and information about the subterranean happenings.
The point is that the country’s geo-ecological system is
not stable and, for that reason, there is a need for public
education and, most importantly, judicious decisions
on human settlement, land use systems, urban and
infrastructure development.

〇〇〇


his is not a particularly good time for farmers in
the North Rift region, the country’s bread basket.
〇〇〇

the shortage occasioned by the recent prolonged drought,
they have become a frustrated lot.
The National Cereals and Produce Board does not seem
to have prepared adequately to take in all their harvest.
It has had to turn away farmers with their produce,
condemning them to heavy losses. And they now find
themselves in double jeopardy, also unable to access a
major input during the planting season: Fertiliser.
The rains are here, and having prepared their farms
early, the depots have run out of fertiliser. This is a mighty
slap in the face of the hardworking farmers, considering
assurances by the government that adequate stocks would
be available as the planting season begins.
To rub salt into the wound, there has been talk of
importing maize from Uganda and elsewhere. Of course
that will enable a few well-connected people to profiteer.
So, while the farmers break their backs to feed the nation,
there are others just waiting in the wings, hoping for
things to go wrong and get onto the gravy train.
The Agriculture ministry must ensure that there is
enough fertiliser so that the preparations for planting do
not go down the drain. It should also enable the NCPB
to buy more produce. That will enhance food security.

re we, really, asking the
right questions about
〇〇〇

Mombasa-Nairobi expressway
that Betchel International Inc
of Francisco, USA, wants to
build for us?
Whichever way you look at
it, this massive infrastructure
project is going to worsen our
already precarious external
indebtedness in major ways.
Apparently, the company
signed a commercial contract
with the Kenya National
Highways Authority (KeNHA)
in August.
These commercial contracts
foreign firms sign with
government departments and
parastatals before scrutiny
by Parliament have been
the biggest contributor to
the accumulation of too
many expensive and poorly
negotiated external loans on
the external loan register.
I don’t take them seriously
when they say that they are
offering us the so-called ‘G-toG’ model and when they claim
that such arrangements make
the projects less expensive to
the taxpayer.
We have been promised
that the American export
credit entities will be involved
in financing the project.
However, the truth of the
matter is that the American
entities are merely going
to provide guarantees to
Betchel in order to make the
project attractive to private
international financiers.
The entities being touted,
such as OPIC and Exim Bank,
are private businesses that
don’t draw money from the
US Government. Unlike the



**ECONOMY**
〇〇〇



Indeed, the only people
who don’t obey this unwritten
global rule are the Chinese.
Several questions arise?
Why are we committing
to such a massive project
without adequate public
scrutiny and discussion? Why
we have signed a commercial
agreement yet there is no
clarity about the source of
financing for the project?
I would have loved to see
robust public debate about the
revenue models and the target
toll price for the project. Not
that I’m a big fan of road tolls.
If it were that simple, how
come we were not able roll it
out on Thika Superhighway?
Tolls work where you have
an alternative to an existing
public road that is slow,
congested and long. You



Chinese Exim Bank, they
don’t put in big money in bigticket infrastructure projects
as large us the expressway.
I stand to be corrected, but
the biggest thing OPIC has
done here in recent times is
the $50 million guarantee
they provided to Boeing to
facilitate the deal that enabled
Kenya Airways to acquire
aeroplanes.
What is my point? It is
that, if you assume blindly
that the Americans have
become so benevolent as to
fork out a sizeable amounts
of their taxpayers’ money to
help us build a highway, you
are daydreaming. This thing
could end up on our lap.
A few years ago, we cheered
wildly when former President
Barack Obama unveiled the
Power Africa project, in the
belief that American dollars
would be deployed in Africa to
fund infrastructure in major
ways.
It did not happen.
What President Obama
offered us in Power Africa
was but a mere framework to
bail in and make it less risky
for US companies to come to
Africa to fund and implement
infrastructure projects on a
commercial basis. There were
no America taxpayers’ dollars
on offer.
Indeed, the US taxpayer is
not in the business of building
large infrastructure projects
in Africa. That responsibility
is for global development
finance institutions such
as the World Bank and the
African Development Bank
(AfDB). Americans do not
compete with these lenders.







pay a premium for using the
motorway because of the time
you save while driving on the
tolled highway.
Why are we rushing before
being provided with, and
debating, comprehensive
demand traffic studies clearly
demonstrating that even
after we have only recently
completed building the
standard gauge railway there
will still be enough traffic
between Mombasa in Nairobi
to make the expressway
commercially viable?
Looking ahead, the debate
about the expressway is the
opportune time for Africa to
debate alternative approaches
to funding large infrastructure
projects.
Africa must move towards
more reliance on domestic
sources and stop depending
on the West for money to
build its roads ports and
dams. External financing
carries currency risks and
comes with conditionalities.

We must turn to our own
sovereign wealth funds and
pension funds for money to
finance infrastructure. Why
don’t we copy Canada and
Australia, where pension
funds allocate 30 per cent of
assets to infrastructure?
Kenya’s pension sector has
assets under management of
$10 billion, most of it sitting
in government paper. If we
adopted the Canadian or
Australian systems, we would
have $3 billion in our hands
to allocate to infrastructure
projects. We don’t have to rely
on these foreigners.

This is the
harsh reality hitting Kenyans in regard to the deal signed
〇〇〇

to put up the multi-billion-shilling standard gauge railway. The
onus is on the government to come out and clarify the matter.
It is a threat to national sovereignty and the country’s economic
independence and stability.
At the core of the matter is the fact that Kenya obtained the
Sh227 billion for constructing the SGR from Mombasa to Nairobi
through a deal in which Kenya Ports Authority’s assets were
attached as collateral — such that, in the event of defaulting,
the lender, China Exim Bank, would take over the properties.
In plain terms, KPA’s assets, which are public properties, were
mortgaged to an international banker and can go anytime should
Kenya fail to pay back the loan.
According to the deal, KPA made a commitment that its revenues would be used to repay the loan should Kenya Railways
Corporation fail to generate enough incomes from cargo ferried
through the line. Then, there was high confidence that the cargo
volumes would surge and generate huge cash to pay off the loan.
For sure, they have risen, but not necessarily to the levels required
to guarantee regular retirement of the loan. This is the risk factor.
Cases from other parts of the world where such transactions
were made but backfired, are well known. Sri Lanka and Zambia
have become textbook examples and underscore the fact that
the threat of losing national assets to private lenders is real.
On balance, the SGR is a game changer. It has transformed
commuter travel between Nairobi and Mombasa. Cargo deliveries have increased and efficiency has improved, especially for
goods destined for Nairobi. But the maths is not adding up. The
devil is in the detail.
A critical challenge has always been the viability of the SGR.
Questions have been raised about its ability to keep itself in
business; raise enough cash to pay off debts. Cargo hauling is
constrained by the fact that commodities are only transportable
up to Nairobi, meaning that freight owners outside the city have
to make other arrangements for deliveries. Costs and inconveniences are huge.
Even without reference to the Auditor-General’s office, which
is reportedly pursuing the matter, the government has a duty to
tell the public the true position. It is a matter of public interest
and cannot be wished away. Public resources cannot be put under
threat and the citizens kept in the dark. We need full disclosure
of the transaction and a clear road map for settling the debt.
〇〇〇


he country is staring at a major crisis with the reported
deaths of nearly 30 elephants in the Maasai Mara Game
〇〇〇

should have prompted a more robust reaction than the ongoing
investigation into the wildlife fatalities.
Elephants are, of course, an endangered species that is often
targeted by poachers for its tusks. A spirited conservation campaign has borne fruit with a marked reduction in the incidence
of poaching. And we laud the Kenya Wildlife Service, security
agencies and other organisations that have made it increasingly
difficult for poachers to wreak havoc with our game.
The country needs these wild animals as are they are part of
our rich natural heritage and a huge attraction in the tourism
industry, contributing to national economic prosperity. It is,
therefore, unacceptable to hear that the causes of death of most
of the 26 elephants are unknown, while 11 might have been
poisoned. We have this information courtesy of a conservation
group, Mara Elephant Project, which has conceded that some of
the deaths in September and November have raised eyebrows.
Knowing just how valuable the elephants and other wild animals
are to our country, we expect a better explanation. After all, Kenya
has distinguished itself in wildlife conservation and the many
experts working in this area should by now have established the
truth. This raises the question as to whether the deaths could
have been natural or the poachers are back but have changed
their tactics, opting for poison instead of rifles.
The public deserves a more cogent report from the KWS, the
Wildlife ministry and the national security agencies on what
could be going on. But, most importantly, urgent measures must
be taken to prevent more deaths of the jumbos.

tuff used to make better
sense 15 years ago.
〇〇〇

could agree on some things.
We could, for example, agree
on what was in the public
interest. Many things used to
work that don’t work today.
We had buses that ran on
time, for example. Educated
people deployed calculated
scepticism in determining
what or whom to believe.
Comedy was fun, humour was
popular. The gentle humanism
of Dr Dawood Kodwavala had
a huge following.
Today, people follow the
angriest, most negative,
narcissistic demagogues.
The professional journalist
is barred from thinking for
you. His job is to provide you
with as clean information as
possible and as compelling
argumentation as accessible
to enable you to make up your
own mind. A certain breed
of NGO activist blogger is a
propagandist of Goebbelsian
purity: His intention is to
think for you, program you
and weaponise you for a cause.
Sometimes the cause is
noble, the means dirty. At
other times the ends are as
basic as the means are filthy.
The tribe of muckraking
bloggers putting naked
pictures on the internet or
inventing prurient affairs are
attention seekers who want to
build big numbers and attract
a bigger paycheck.
But we choose to believe
and worship the charlatans
and quacks. This is the age
of disbelief in values and
human goodness. This is the
generation that has rejected
cerebral hygiene and allowed



its temple of reason to be
polluted by effluent from the
sickness of peeping tomery,
motiveless malice, common
envy and self-loathing.
But there is a gentler place
where people get along, the
sky is blue, the breeze is
gentle and the grass is moist
with the dew of kindness,
generosity, love, forgiveness,
peace, happiness and hope.
This is the place, with your
permission, I want to argue
the case for.
So here are some three
suggestions to think about
as you hit the malls for
Christmas shopping or head
to the stage for your bus
upcountry.
First, be sure to visit your
parents this holiday. Spend
either Christmas or New Year
with them. A lady told us a
couple of months back that a
large number of old people,
even affluent old people who
are otherwise well taken care
of, are dying of hunger. There
is plenty of food in the house,
but is there someone making
sure that they are eating?


**Photos of grandchildren**
It’s not enough to prepare
and serve the food; somebody
has to ensure that it has been
eaten. You can judge the
civilisation of a culture by how
it treats its most vulnerable
— the young and the old. In
my tribe, it is believed that
how you treat your parents
is exactly the same way your
children will treat you. If
you don’t take your children
to spend time with their
grandparents, you will only
be seeing photos of your
grandchildren in your old age.



Secondly, it is perfectly
okay to be patriotic. Our
country is like a house. It
provides us with shelter and
security. If we keep it clean
and cared for, it will provide
the same services for our
children and our children’s
children. The better we take
care of it, the better it serves
us. We are the owners of the
house; the government is the
housekeeper. We have to give
it instructions and supervise it
to do a good job.
Would you, in your own
house, allow the housegirl
to change the baby on the
dining table and leave the
used diaper there just because
she is from your tribe? Would
you sit back and do nothing
if your houseboy took your
children’s fees, went out and
drunk lots of Johnnie Walker
Red Label with his mates,
bought a Chinese motorcycle
and a plot in Kamulu, because
he is from your tribe?
Thirdly, not everything is
about you. There are things
you can own, and there are
things you should leave well
alone. A lot of these folks who
have stolen so much money
from national institutions,
they will never spend a
fraction of it. It is too much.


〇〇〇
〇〇〇


〇〇〇





And even when they do, it will
add nothing to the quality of
their lives, not change how
they feel about themselves,
how much peace and joy is
contained in their souls.
If you condemn a poor, sick
person to certain death so that
you can buy a level of luxury
nobody needs or deserves,
you will not find peace in this
or the next life. Eat the little
you have with your family and
invite your neighbour too.
Finally, it is okay to
appreciate those who do good.
To confess that someone
is doing a good job, if it is
factual that they are; it does
not mean you have joined the
Jubilee government, become a
sycophant or lost your mind.
Appreciation encourages
others to emulate a good
example. Gratitude is a debt
we must pay for good service.
I thank Director of Public
Prosecution Noordin Haji
and his police counterpart,
Mr George Maingi Kinoti, for
their diligent work. They are
good, honest Kenyans. For the
first time, we have government
officials who have truly struck
terror into the hearts of the
corrupt. If they keep it up for
a year and they investigate
and prosecute all corruption,
Kenya will make progress.
Prof George Magoha is an
outstanding public servant
who has contributed to the
enforcement of integrity in
examinations. In the Cabinet,
Dr Fred Matiang’i remains the
most effective and coherent.
This makes sense doesn’t
it?
Merry Christmas.

grated regional transport corridors
instead of one, faster and at a cost
considerably lower than the proposed LAPPSET route. It would
now be possible to consign cargo
destined to Nairobi or Kampala
to either Mombasa or Lamu, and
similarly, cargo destined for South
Sudan or Ethiopia to either of the
two ports.
The case for the Mombasa-Nairobi routing of the new railway was
predicated on decongesting the
highway by shifting all the cargo
back onto the railway. This calls
into question why the Jubilee
administration is investing a colossal amount of borrowed money,
almost the same as the railway, on
the same corridor when LAPSSET
remains unfunded. It is highly
unlikely that explanations will be
forthcoming.
Besides this purely economic
logic, the other equally compelling
case for LAPSSET is promoting
equitable development. This
happens to be constitutional imperative, as spelled out in Article
201 of the Constitution to wit
“the public finance system shall
promote an equitable society (Article 201(b) and “expenditure shall
promote the equitable development
of the country, including by making
special provisions for marginalized
groups and areas” (201(b)(iii)).
In constitutional parlance, these
provisions are known as directive
principles of public policy. The
primary mechanism for pursuing



Gikuyu saying _úrimú no ta úthungú_
(foolishness is like whiteness),

As luck would have it, I had the
occasion to register my views with
the current US envoy, at a lunch
tête-à-tête over salmon when he
brought up Power Africa as evidence of benign US aid to change
the subject from the agenda of
the meeting namely, the military
aircraft deal that had failed John
Githongo’s “smell test.“
He was rather piqued with
my immediate retort that it was
nothing more than a vendor-driven
commercial initiative. It struck me
then, on reflection, that it could
not be a coincidence that rural
electrification is one of Jubilee
administration’s flagship infrastructure programmes.
When Bechtel Corporation the
company in the highway deal first
appeared on these shores, it was
in connection with the LAPSSET
project.
Readers of this column may
recall that one of the grounds on
which I opposed the MombasaNairobi standard gauge rail project
right from the outset was that
LAPSSET was the better project.
In fact, my preferred routing was
from Lamu to Thika via Kitui and
onwards to Nanyuki along the existing derelict railway line, which
I called “LAPSSET lite.” The logic
is straightforward.

sharing system that it prescribes
(In the interest of disclosure, this
author worked on this chapter of

It is a matter of public record
that the Jubilee administration
leadership opposes devolution and
many other fundamental principles
of the 2010 Constitution.
Uhuru Kenyatta is on record
blaming the Constitution for his
administration’s underwhelming
performance. William Ruto was
leader of the NO campaign. Both
Uhuru and Ruto have in recent days
bragged that they have sufficient
strength in Parliament to change
the Constitution.
Between the Mombasa- Nairobi
SGR and this new highway, we are
talking over US$ 6b, a third of the



a large US construction company
signed a Sh300 billion contract
to build a new Mombasa Nairobi
highway.
The contract, signed three days
before election is a carbon copy of
the Standard Gauge railway deal—a
single sourced, turnkey project to
be financed by US Governmentbacked commercial loans. Can’t

When he took office, Obama’s

couple of years ago, a former

country on a mission (he had
since retired and was then, still

He was refreshingly forthright on
what his mission was — China.
He wanted to know why China
was penetrating Africa, how the
penetration was perceived by the
people, and what the US could do
to stem the tide.
Shortly after the parley, Hillary
Clinton then Obama’s Foreign
Secretary made her infamous
comments in Dakar, Senegal, her
first stop on her maiden Africa
tour where she characterized
US as committed to “a model of
sustainable partnership that adds
value, rather than extracts it” and
further that “America will stand
up for democracy and universal
human rights even when it might
be easier to look the other way and
keep the resources flowing.”
The comments left no doubt that
she was talking about China. A few
days later in Zambia, she was explicit: “We are, however, concerned
that China’s foreign assistance and
investment practices in Africa have
not always been consistent with
generally accepted international
norms of transparency and good
governance, and that it has not
always utilized the talents of the
African people in pursuing its
business interests.”

here is a general consensus
that the future of any nation
〇〇〇

young people. For this reason, special attention should be paid to this
segment of the population to help
them fulfil their purpose as potential
leaders.
Leadership is both an art and a
science through which the affairs of
any society are directed. As such, it
is critical that young people acquire
moral standards and values that will
mould them into individuals who are
ready to lead and ensure progress.
We have seen a disturbing trend
among our youth in the last few
months. There have been cases of
drug and alcohol abuse, the gangster
lifestyle and, recently, students setting their own schools on fire.
Society is not static and changes
have been accelerated because of
issues such as technology, globalisation and migration. Simple



traditional societies have evolved
into complex modern societies. Just
as societies have developed, values
have also continued to change to suit
the character of a changing world.
This has brought in an increased
wave of moral decadence and moral
laxity in present-day societies. We,
however, would like to restate that
the old adage ‘Train a child in the
way he should go and when he is old,
he shall not depart from it” still remains relevant amid all the changes.
Everyone in society has a role
to play, to be their brothers’ keepers. We must go back to the basics.
Parents must ask their schoolgoing
children to take back pencils and
pens if they did not buy them. By
failing to do so, parents are teaching
their children dishonesty and, soon,
this will catch up with us as a society. We urge every parent to have an
appropriate parent-child relationship
to address social imbalances with a

done repeatedly make all the difference over time.
While interrogating the behaviour
of young people today, we realised
that they are faced with peculiar
problems that challenge their moral
stance. They are surrounded by people who have thrown morality aside
and are succeeding in life. Society
appears to celebrate corruption and
favour those who can do anything
to make money. In short, we have
contributed to the trend we are
seeing in our young people today.
Research has shown that the value
system of the youth is an important
indicator of specific trends of the
societies where they live. As Kenyans, we should note that the current
situation in our society affects the
formation of values and attitudes
and actual behaviour of young people.
All what we have said notwithstanding, we would like to speak to



all young people. We know you are
energetic and some of you are willing to go the extra mile if need be
to achieve what you believe in. You
have the power within you to bring
about the change you want to see.
You can choose to make a positive
impact by the way you live. Do not
give up. We would like to remind
you that the world still celebrates
men and women of great values who
held onto and continue to hold onto
values that are both undeniable and
true. Stand to be counted. The power
lies in your hands. Learn to utilise
this power to make Kenya a better

university a bridge to meaningful lives of dignity and promise.
The five-year Sh2 billion World Bank plan includes institutions
in Tanzania and Ethiopia and will target an overhaul of infrastructure and learning and teaching equipment, as well as infusion of
fresh content in curriculum and training of faculty. Especially
remarkable is that the colleges will be turned into specialisation
hubs in fields such as transport and infrastructure, marine studies,
power, energy and information and communication technology.
The project could not have come at a more opportune time —
just as the country begins implementing the competency-based
curriculum (CBC) in basic education and competency-based
education and training (Cbet) in higher levels. The changes will
give special focus to individual talents and interests as opposed
to performance in summative national examinations. They also
hope to dispel the long-held misconception that the only way to
higher education is to join university and graduate with a degree.
Technical, vocational education and training (TVET) colleges
have suffered neglect through the years as secondary school
leavers trooped to universities for diploma and degrees while
those ineligible for the institutions joined informal employment,
got lured into crime or simply idled in the villages, jobless and
hopeless. Only a handful joined the rundown TVET colleges,
which became synonymous with dilapidation, outdated curriculums and severe staff shortages. Those who joined the colleges
were seen as losers and failures as opposed to those in university.
It is, therefore, prudent that the government is reviving the
TVET colleges to turn them into producers of graduates with apt
technical and vocational skills which dovetail with the country’s
national economic goals as laid out in the Kenya Vision 2030 and
Jubilee’s ‘Big Four Agenda’ to reform healthcare, manufacturing,
housing and food security, hoping to uplift living conditions.
However, the government must first figure out how to make
these colleges attractive to prospective students and parents
who regard them as moribund and outdated. It could begin with
presentations in schools on the courses on offer and the job
opportunities. It would be a national shame to put up technical
colleges in every county in addition to the existing ones if no
student ever goes there or those who do end up being jobless.
While we support the ongoing reforms, we urge the government
to undertake a public education campaign on the role of TVETs
in the country’s economic development, besides speeding up the
planned upgrade of the colleges.

he off-season break in football offers teams a chance
to review their performance and lay new strategies
〇〇〇

to strengthen their squads. Sadly, Kenyan clubs that will
compete internationally in the 2019/2020 football season do
not seem to be doing much to get ready.
Kenyan Premier League champions Gor Mahia and league
runners-up Bandari will represent the country in Caf Champions League and Caf Confederation Cup, respectively, when
the 2019/2020 football season starts in August. Because both
Gor Mahia and domestic cup winners Bandari will play in the
preliminary stage of these tournaments in August, the teams
must start early preparations to perform better.
Last season, Gor were bundled out of Caf Champions League
in the early stages and relegated to the second-tier tournament,
Caf Confederation Cup. But although Gor Mahia went on to
reach the quarter-finals of Caf Confederation Cup, the team could
have done even better with proper leadership and preparation.
Because Gor Mahia and Bandari will compete in the Council
for East and Central Africa Football Associations (Cecafa) club
championships next month in Rwanda, the two teams should use
the tournament to prepare for the continental stage. The regional
tournament will give Gor Mahia and Bandari an opportunity to
test themselves against seasoned teams.
However, the clubs must recruit quality players to match
stronger competition at the regional and continental stages. There
is no shortcut to success in competitions other than sound leadership, strategic recruitment of players and proper preparation.

he standard gauge
railway (SGR) project
〇〇〇

toy car I recently bought
for my nephew in a local
supermarket. It was Chinesemade, remote-controlled and
looked like a lovely cruiser.
But when we took it home
and tried it out, it only lit up,
crackled a little but did not
move an inch.
My nephew’s
disappointment was a sight
to behold. No amount of new
batteries and engineering
expertise could get the toy car
moving. It just sits there now,
cluttering the place, until we
find something more durable
to appease the little boy.
Like my nephew’s toy, the
SGR initiation was followed by
excitement, pomp and colour
and, to many Kenyans, it
appears not to have lived up to
expectations. The bullet train
was not what arrived; we got
just a bog-standard train that
was newer and shinier than
the one before it.
The commute to and from
the railway station turns out to
be like by the good old matatu
— only that it has been given
a posher name of ‘shuttle’. The
location of Nairobi Terminus
for me was a little confusing
to start with; it turned out that
it was, in fact, in Syokimau,
Machakos County, and not in
the city county!
Having not kept abreast
with the new Nairobi
Terminus while out of the
country, I remember recently
arriving at the now-old Nairobi
Railway Station maiden
SRG train ride. It took a
kind security guard, and not
notices or signposting, for me



to know Nairobi Terminus had
‘moved’. I had about an hour
to get through the heavy city
traffic in a taxi to catch my
afternoon train to Mombasa,
which I still missed!
SGR, however, has life in it.
It is easier to keep it and make
it work somehow — unlike
my nephew’s ‘car’, which will
certainly end up in the trash.
The great thing about SGR
is that it is quite economical
for a light traveller who can
easily catch a matatu to and
from the new stations. But
if you have large suitcases
and depending on taxis like
I did, it ends up being quite
expensive. A one-way journey
ended up costing me Sh5,000,
including the ticket. The little
things — such as location,
information on all connections
and extra costs that were not
initially factored in — have
become inconveniencing to
some passengers.


**Amazing and scenic route**
The old Nairobi and
Mombasa terminuses are
of great historical value and
would have better attracted
many tourists to the new train.
Again, the Nairobi-Mombasa
railway line cuts through one
of the most amazing and
scenic routes in the world,
with its concentration of
wildlife. A spectacle to enjoy,
even on ‘Madaraka Express’.
However, what I found
of concern are the barbed
wire built along both sides
of the track, in some places,
double-wired. That restricts
movement of animals to one
side of the track. Clearly,
freedom of movement of
animals was overlooked.


〇〇〇




The wires are features that
were not there before and are
disrupting natural flow of wild
animals across the savannah.
A recent report on the BBC
wildlife series showed that
animals such as elephants
are, in fact, getting caught in
the barbed wires they never
envisaged along their routes.
I fail to see the logic of
having barbed wire around the
latest tracks or inside animal
reserves. The traditional ecofriendly cactus hedges would
have sufficed. The savannah
is one of the rarest animal
habitats in the world and
fencing off the rail tracks
with barbed wires to inhibit
animal’s natural flow has the
potential of decimating them
and completely changing the
character of this unique land.







The environmental
challenges posed by SGR,
particularly on wildlife, is well
documented. The disregard
for the concern on wildlife
along the SGR line shows our
lack of appreciation of our
wildlife heritage. No doubt,
conservation of wildlife has
become a ‘white’ people affair
and explains mushrooming of
conservation units in private
firms and ranches.
The natural conservation
of wildlife needs to be in the
natural habitat in which they
are found. We have set up
many such parks and reserves
for wildlife and efforts must
be made to preserve their
uniqueness, even as we
embrace development projects
such as the SGR.
Wildlife deserve to be
part of the environment. We
found them here, after all.
The human-wildlife conflict
we keep hearing about can be
partly resolved by educating
the local communities on
how best to coexist with
wild animals. To bring up
future generations that
can appreciate this unique
heritage, conservation must be
made part of our curriculum.
Most importantly, growth
of human settlements must be
planned away from the wildlife
reserves and migration routes.
We can’t colonise natural
wildlife habitats and then cry
of being mauled.
Conservation needs to form
part of our DNA as we are
the natural custodians of this
unique heritage of wildlife —
just as it was centuries ago.

〇〇〇

transport that had collapsed in the 1990s was certainly a noble
objective. Chaos on the road and the huge flight costs necessitated
alternative transport modes. A railway, with its capacity for large
haul and affordable costs, was the best option.
But the SGR came at an astronomical cost and, whereas it
has eased transport between Nairobi and Mombasa since its
completion and launch in June 2017, it is a major drain to the
economy. The government spends Sh1.5 billion every month on
operational costs yet the incomes from ticket sales and cargo
haulage is just Sh841 million, less by nearly half the expenses.
Yet that is just the overhead. The total cost of putting up the
rail line was Sh327 billion, paid back at an interest rate of more
than five per cent for 15 years. Comparatively, neighbours like
Tanzania and Ethiopia have done or are working on more expansive rail projects, and shopping for electric trains, at a far much
lower price. To be sure, Kenya’s are diesel-powered trains yet the
trend worldwide is electric, which is efficient and cost-effective.
Details published in this newspaper this week point to a project that was customised to rob taxpayers. Construction costs,
including peripherals like office and welfare expenses, were hugely
inflated, making it a mega rip-off. Worse, in a country teeming
with thousands of educated but unemployed youth, the Chinese
contractors audaciously brought some 6,000 of their nationals
to do the work locals could do. The bulk of materials for the rail
line was imported, meaning local suppliers scarcely gained from a
project on their land. We exported cash and vacated jobs abroad.
The project had all the markings of a swindle. Contracting
was shrouded in mystery and despite pledges by none other
than President Uhuru Kenyatta that the documents would be
made public for public scrutiny, nothing has been forthcoming.
Unfortunately, even after the disaster of the first phase, the
government went ahead to extend the line to Suswa, hopefully,
to expand to the western circuit. Having been launched in pomp
and glamour, the extended line is a dud. No cargo has ever been
moved in what has aptly been tagged the line to nowhere. Passenger transport is on and off.
SGR may stand out as the most expansive project under the
current administration. But it is a scandal of monumental proportion. Investigative agencies have an obligation to interrogate this
matter and bring criminal charges against those who signed the
contracts and committed the country to this economic morass.

outh Sudan’s President Salva Kiir and his erstwhile rival
Riek Machar finally formed the long-awaited Transitional

Wherever they may be, South Sudanese must have sighed with
a huge relief at the prospect of their motherland once against
being steered towards peace, stability and prosperity.
Compliments also go to all the stakeholders, who in whichever
way, made the milestones a reality. Regional bloc Inter-Governmental Authority on Development (Igad) and the Troika (the
US, the UK and Norway) never at any time blinked in nudging
the South Sudan leaders to close ranks.
However, the formation of the transitional government was the
easier part. The hard work begins now, to ensure that the peace
deal holds for the intended three years and eventually paves the
way for a new leadership elected under universal adult suffrage.
The interim government must not fail the people this time round.
Having resolved the contentious issue of the state boundaries,
President Kiir and Dr Machar must now pay special attention
to the sensitive issue of security arrangement.
The vetting and training of their respective soldiers is ongoing
but the unification of armed groups and the training of the 1,500
elite force to protect the VIPs has not yet been done. That must
be done as a matter of urgency for the last flare-up in 2013 revolved around security or lack thereof for Dr Machar in particular.
South Sudanese civilians have suffered for far too long as
their leaders haggle over power. President Kiir and Dr Machar
should now be ready for the consequences should they fail in
their renewed mandate.

utahi Kagwe will
shortly be taking
〇〇〇

fourth Health Cabinet
secretary in seven years.
Clearly, it has been a revolving
door. Mr Kagwe comes in
a time when many people
who used to support the
idea of a Cabinet made up
of technocrats have become
cynics.
With only two years left
before a new administration
comes in, the former senator
for Nyeri may not be able to
do much to make a big impact
at to leave fingerprints and
a legacy at Afya House. If he
approaches the assignment
as if he is a manager with
solutions to every problem at
the ministry, he may not make
such a big impact.
Here is some food for
thought and suggestions for
the CS on some of the recent
and emerging issues and areas
he may consider focusing on.
First, can he consider
leading a national discussion
on what ought to be done to
bring down the cost of private
healthcare in Kenya.
Clearly, one of the single
most important failures of
policy in the medical sector is
the cost of private healthcare.
Kenyans are flocking to India
in large numbers because that
country has become the first
resort of medical care to our
people.
The main factor behind
patients flocking to India are
high prices here. A patient can
afford to pay for air tickets
for three relatives, receive a
month’s worth of high-quality
care while living with the
relatives in rented quarters



in India, and travel back to
Kenya having paid far less
than what he would have
paid to a private hospital in
Nairobi.
When you ask why hospital
charges are high, you only
hear theories and arguments
that are not evidence-based —
such as specialists demanding
high reimbursements,
overutilisation of specialists
and too many referrals.
If you tracked the medical
component in the Consumer
Price Index, the trend you
would see is that the cost of
medical services has been
rising faster than overall
inflation. And, medical
insurance premiums are high
because healthcare provider
prices are incredibly high.
Indeed, the cost of private
healthcare in Kenya is a
national scandal.
Mr Kagwe takes over in
the wake of a raging debate
about a recent media exposé
on the invasion and takeover
of several private hospitals
by vulture-type private equity
funds from Europe.


**Provide leadership**
We read how hospitals have
been repurposed into moneyminting machines. We were all
horrified about cases where
patients were being admitted
when they did not need it,
clinical officers paid bonuses
for admitting more patients
and keeping patients longer in
the wards and sky-high prices
for minor procedures.
The new minister must
provide leadership in finding a
solution for this dysfunctional
healthcare system.
I am not a supporter of price


〇〇〇
〇〇〇



controls, though. I believe that
prices must reflect the true
costs and that prices must
sufficiently reward heathcare
providers. However, maybe it
is time to debate a new light
price regulatory regime to
monitor, record and introduce
some transparency in the
pricing of medical services.
What we have now
is a healthcare market
characterised by such failures
as information asymmetry,
wide price variations for
similar services across
hospitals and lack of
information on prices.
Or should we introduce
some light consumer
protection regime for private
medical services? How can we
make prices more transparent
and at the same time blunt the
monopoly private healthcare
providers have, allowing them
to raise prices at will?







Mr Kagwe should reform
the National Hospital
Insurance Fund (NHIF), the
largest parastatal under the
ministry. The turnover of
CEOs is high while the board
is just too wieldy and carries
just too many interest groups
whose ideas cannot mesh.
Last year, Mr Kagwe’s
predecessor, Sicily Kariuki,
appointed a task force to study
the NHIF and recommend
improvements to the fund’s
effectiveness, especially as the
country transitions to a regime
of universal health coverage.
The most remarkable
finding was that NHIF was not
fiscally sustainable and faced
governance challenges. I found
that tame and timid.
The title of the committee
was, itself, just too bombastic
and left you with the
impression that the whole
thing was not well thoughtout: “Health Financing
Reform Expert Panel for
the Transformation and
Repositioning of the National
Health Insurance Fund”.
It neither came up with nor
discussed radical solutions
on how to disrupt a system
steeped in corruption and
mismanagement. A good
manager not only manages the
urgent; he must keep his eyes
on what is important and seek
answers to the big issues and
questions in the sector.
Why is the public health
sector haemorrhaging nurses
to advanced markets? Why
does the ministry find it
difficult to honour collective
bargaining agreements signed
with doctors and nurses?

enya needs to take a serious look at its infrastructure development plan following the failure of its bid to obtain


from Naivasha to Kisumu and ultimately the Uganda border. The
Chinese government, which has been exuberant with cash doleouts, pointedly rejected Kenya’s quest for a new loan — estimated
at Sh360 billion — to complete modernising its rail network. The
reason was simple: Kenya is getting overburdened with loans and
is becoming a risky borrower.
The Chinese authorities did not have to make this point to the
Kenya government. It has been obvious to everybody that the
government is mortgaging the country with huge debts. Cumulatively, Kenya is operating a debt portfolio of Sh5.4 trillion, the
bulk linked to infrastructure, and which fi gure is nearly double the
country’s annual budget.
On SGR alone, the line from Mombasa to Naivasha has attracted
a Sh500 billion loan, and extension to Kisumu was bound to raise
the fi gure to more than Sh800 billion. Put together with other infrastructure loans, Kenya was getting weighed down with Chinese
debt — let alone others.
SGR phase one that rolled from Mombasa to Nairobi has been
hailed as the best development project in modern Kenya. It has
transformed long-distance transport, eased operations for the Kenya
Ports Authority and reduced costs for transporters and business
people. But the cost of putting it up was prohibitive. Unfortunately,
despite increased cargo freight and commuter traffi c, it is making
losses. Government estimates last year indicated that the line made
losses to the tune of Sh750 million a month.
With the third leg of the SGR to Kisumu put on hold, several
questions arise. Will the entire project make economic sense? Does
it make sense for transporters and business people to ferry goods
from Mombasa and drop them at an inland port in Naivasha? Is
it feasible to revive the old railway from Naivasha to Kisumu to
complete the circuit? What does it mean for western Kenya that
was hinging its hopes on it? What about neighbouring countries
that were angling to benefi t from it?
The Chinese experience is a sad reminder of the tragedy of
development politics. It is imperialistic in nature and even though
China, in the early years, opened fi nancial taps to developing countries, mainly from Africa and without stringent conditionalities, the
reality is that everything is about business. Western donors may
have been frugal and harsh but everything boils down to economics.
African countries must swallow that bitter pill.
Kenya must tame its appetite for loans and rethink its infrastructure development model.

rangles in the Boxing Association of Kenya (BAK) are
threatening to deny the country a chance to select a
〇〇〇

and the African Games.
The simmering row between a faction led by BAK chairman John
Kameta and another led by his deputy Albert Matito has boiled
over, with each group coming up with its own plans for the team
selection tournament, the Kenya Open Boxing Championship.
At the heart of the dispute is failure by the offi cials to agree on a
common date and venue for the championship. Whereas Matito’s
faction has insisted on staging the bouts in Nairobi in line with a
calendar of events agreed upon in a meeting convened by former
Sports Cabinet Secretary Rashid Echesa last November, Kameta’s
faction has insisted on staging the tournament in Mombasa.
In the past two days, Matito’s faction held the tournament at
Charter Hall in Nairobi while Kameta’s faction staged a parallel
one in Mombasa.
Among others, wrangles threw last year’s national league into
disarray as both factions staged parallel competitions. The 2017
national league competition also ended in controversy, with the
Kenya Police boxing team being stripped of the title. Furthermore,
a consultative committee comprising offi cials from the two factions
is yet to lay down modalities for BAK elections.
The current wrangles leave Kenya’s participation in the World
Championships and Africa Games planned for later this year in
limbo. Its participation in the 2020 Olympic Games is also threatened because the African Games are likely to be used as a qualifi er
tournament for the Olympics. These issues need urgent resolution.

his entire week, an epic
battle between Church
〇〇〇

raged. This has been a battle
between those who believe that
the church of Christ should
steer away from the pursuit
of money, while the other is
adamant that the smell of dirty
money is only in the nostrils
of hypocrites. It appears that
the former have taken to heart
the biblical exhortation to
Christians: “No man can serve

two masters … You cannot
serve God and Mammon”.
In the middle ages
(described as the period
between 500 and 1500AD),
Mammon was recognised as
the god of wealth and profi t
in its negative connotations,
and the homily in Apostle
Matthew’s Gospel was
probably as a result of ageold practices that were
contemptible then, and are still
beneath contempt today. But it
will never do to condemn the
church for seeking material
independence, which can
never be attained unless with
the generous contributions
of worshippers. Incidentally,
Matthew is the patron saint of
tax collectors and accountants,
so he knew what he was talking
about.
It is not quite clear what our
leading clerics are objecting to
all of a sudden considering that
seeking assistance from wellto-do worshippers is nothing to
fl agellate their own hides about
— people of means have always
donated sizeable amounts
of money during church
harambees and nobody has
ever raised a voice. Therefore,
one can detect a whiff of
politics in the emerging
protestations targeting one or



**RELIGION**
〇〇〇



two individuals for their wellpublicised generosity, but then
politics has a way of dirtying
everything it touches.
In any case, coming
from church leaders, this
admonition is rather rich. Very
few princes of the church have
shied away from accepting
donations of any kind and
some of the money may not
even have been used for God’s
work. Indeed, whatever their
shortcomings, our religious
leaders are no worse than the
Catholic popes and cardinals of
old whose history would make
most people cringe. According
to historians, the so-called
Renaissance period (between
the 13th and 14th centuries)
when popes also held temporal
powers was coloured by so
much evil that few Catholics
today want to learn about
it. Sexual orgies, pederasty,
murder, assassinations,
corruption, simony, and
nepotism have always been
part of the early Christian
tradition.
On the other hand, the
Catholic Church has had
popes who tried to act as the
conscience of nations. For
instance, the current primate,
Pope Francis, besides trying
to deal with sexual depravity
among bishops, archbishops
and cardinals, has also been in
the forefront in fi ghting social
and economic inequities to the
extent that he has been labelled
the fi rst Marxist Pope. There
is no doubt we will hear a lot
more from him as he tries to
reform the Church. The same
cannot be said of mainstream
protestant churches, or the
more troublesome charismatic
movements whose raison d’être
seems to be to fl eece their fl ock



by promising them heaven
even if they have to bankrupt
themselves.
But what could Kenyan
religious leaders possibly say
about material possessions
if they never question the
source of this largesse?
They are all hedging their
bets. They do not want to
condemn donations to the
church wholesale. At the same
time, they have been under
severe attack by Kenyans who
believe the donations are the
proceeds of corruption, even
if no evidence is adduced
to that eff ect. What they
object to is ostentatious
display of opulence during
church fundraisers, and the
introduction of politics at the
pulpit. In this one, there is
an element of hypocrisy; they
could use the help, but they
sure do not want to deal with
the ethical issues surrounding







the ways in which this money
was acquired.
A possible solution to this
conundrum is to strictly limit
the huge number of church
harambees that worshippers
are subjected to every Sunday
and other church holidays;
they are altogether too many.
On any Sunday, there is one
kind of harambee or another.
Nobody would object if the
fund drives were held to build
imposing edifi ces for the Lord
and furnish them with elegant
pulpits and comfortable seats
for the worshippers. Nobody
would feel bad if asked to
contribute money for buying
tents, furniture and food
utensils which can be hired
out to raise funds for churchrelated activities.
But if you are a villager
without any regular source
of income, yet every Sunday
you are expected to contribute
money for Church School,
Church Youth, Women’s
Guild, Men’s Fellowship, and
Christian Education, on top
of numerous other cesses,
where are you expected to
raise the money from? On
such occasions, the villagers
end up contributing Sh20 or
Sh50 because that is all they
can aff ord. Is it any wonder
that some church leaders will
always prefer to invite wellheeled individuals as chief
guests? According to some,
there is no “clean” or “dirty”
money in the eyes of the Lord.
In fact, one of them has gone
as far as saying the church is
“not a house of saints”. He is
quite right of course; Kenyans
know this only too well.

he debate about how much debt Kenya can prudently absorb
is, once again, in the air after a Parliament granted the Na## T tional Treasury’s wish to raise the borrowing ceiling to Sh9

trillion. Coming a couple of years after the House accommodated
a borrowing binge to raise the cap to Sh6 trillion, there was a
palpable fear that the government was up to its bad ways again.
However, the Treasury defends the new limit as different for
being absolute and not a fleeting target that is afforded by tying
it to the country’s productive capacity. One can easily charge the
Treasury of deceit as the debt, at Sh5.9 trillion as of June, was
already 56 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) against a
developing country benchmark of 40 per cent.
With the government intending to borrow another Sh630
billion this year, the ratio would have jumped to about 61 per
cent of GDP. Why, then, was the ceiling not raised to, say, Sh6.6
trillion to accommodate the immediate borrowing gap if the whole
essence of review was to curb the government’s debt appetite?
Critics say the headroom was meant to extend comfort to partners who have committed to do mega projects such as the ‘Big
Four’, the Mombasa-Nairobi highway, Lapsset transport corridor,
Likoni bridge, another bridge at Nyali, as well as the successive
extension of the standard gauge railway to western Kenya. The
World Bank has already warned that Kenya is trotting towards
debt distress, a view fiercely contested by the government.
Whatsoever the case, the debates on Kenya’s debt need to move
from the realm of numbers — which each party can interpret
differently — to the context of realities confronting the economy.
First, were the government a person, it would not spend more
than a third of its income on repaying loans. Kenya has stretched
that to the limit. Secondly, the country has taken in subsequent
commercial loans at worse rates — a sign of rising anxiety among
lenders over its creditworthiness. Thirdly, key foreign exchange
earners are in decline, meaning the ability to service mounting
debt will be constrained in time as climate change takes a toll on
agriculture while the productivity of the manufacturing sector
has been in the wane for years.
These factors mean the Treasury has to constantly look within
and live within its means to finance its budget; a fiscal consolidation the absolute debt ceiling signals with a target of debt-to-GDP
ratio of 44 per cent. Increasing domestic production, balancing
public sector spending and decidedly shifting to concessional
debt are paramount for Kenya to avoid debt stress.
In the circumstances, Parliament should not raise the ceiling yet.

〇〇〇


he many cases of police officers suspected of involvement
in crime are a source of grave concern. Here are people
〇〇〇

target the same citizens they are supposed to protect. It is an
abuse of trust that threatens to erode the public confidence in the
National Police Service, an indispensable institution in society.
Rogue police officers are committing crimes, including robberies. Nearly 50 officers have been charged with various crimes
in the past five weeks. Recently, a policeman is suspected to
have been in a gang that robbed traders of millions of shillings
in Eastleigh, Nairobi. On September 26, a soldier and three Administration Police constables were arrested over a Sh72 million
ATM bank heist, also in the capital city.
It is not surprising, therefore, to hear that the National Police
Service Commission has warned the public to be on the lookout
for a criminal who is armed and dangerous but, most importantly,
is a police officer gone rogue. This is chilling. It is an indication
that something has gone pretty wrong with this institution,
whose cardinal duty is to fight crime.
Worse, the crooks use government-issue guns. It can never
get more depraved. True, the Internal Affairs Unit and the Directorate of Criminal Investigations have stepped up efforts to
rid the service of criminals in uniform. Also playing a key role
is the Independent Policing Oversight Authority (Ipoa), which
says it has prosecuted 67 such cases. But more needs to be done.
Inspector-General of Police Hillary Mutyambai says this is not
a true reflection of the service but, nevertheless, concedes that
a few crooked officers are tainting its image.
The crooks in uniform must be flushed out and punished.

did write in this space
about the dangers of
〇〇〇

This is a matter that now
needs serious reconsideration
in light of abuse of power and
live ammunition by the police.
The level of criminality
reportedly involving the police
is stuff for Hollywood movies;
unfortunately, it is real and
ordinary Kenyans that bear
the brunt of the vice.
The video of bar owners in
Kayole allegedly threatened
with shooting if they failed
to bribe the police is spinechilling. And Lamu residents
recently reported being
maimed, tortured and beaten
by officers overzealously
searching for a lost colleague.
Without going into Willie
Kimani’s case in detail for
legal reasons, we should still
feel concerned that it is police
officers facing murder charges
in one of the most shocking
cases of homicide in Kenya.
We also have a case
involving a group of officers
from Kayole suspected to
be behind the alleged armed
robbery of businessmen in
Eastleigh. That followed the
Sh72 million heist, again
allegedly by police officers.
Overall, cases of officers
being part and parcel
of an avalanche of wellchoreographed thefts have hit
the headlines daily.
But you don’t solve this
level of crime by arming
another bunch of security
personnel, private or public. It
is the most irresponsible thing
to do. It will only add fuel to
the fire by giving even more
people arms to join the fray
of robbing and looting in the

is left wondering whether
the National Police Service
has done enough to train its
officers on the Constitution
and instil in them their legal
responsibilities.
Why are our officers so
aggressive towards the public?
And why are they out in force
to stop people from exercising
their right to protest? The
most important question to
ask, in fact, is, why do police
treat citizens as the enemy
rather than people to whom
they owe legal duty of care?
The answer to my last
question lies, perhaps, in the
policing culture that has been
left to fester for decades —
that of brutality, extrajudicial
killings and extortion. It also
lies in how we train the police.
If you teach a dog to bite,
that is exactly what it is going



guise of fighting crime.
Police have been allowed to
handle policing matters and
citizens in a heavy-handed
way, such that they deploy the
same tactics when they want
to rob and extort money from
ordinary wananchi.
The change of name in the
Constitution does not seem to
have made a dent in how the
crop of modern police need
to deal with the public — in a
dignified way, within the law.
The brutality meted out
by the police is a remnant
of colonial laws used to
intimidate Africans by their
white masters. The colonial
Emergency Law should not
have a place in Kenya. These
are habits that have been
expunged by the Constitution
in order to indigenise policing
matters and make them much
more humane and just.
I am in London, being
inconvenienced and stressed
like many other people
by ‘Extinction Rebellion’
demonstrators against climate
change. They have literally
taken over the city but there is
no stopping them since they
are exercising their civic right
as provided for in law.


**Spirit of the Constitution**
It is sobering for me to
see how the police handle
the unruly demonstrators
respectfully and with dignity,
even as they escort them to
the police cells.
Watching the Kenyan police
last week harass and stop
Mombasa residents from
peacefully demonstrating
against the SGR shows that
the spirit of the Constitution
is not being adhered to. One







to do; but if you teach it to
sniff out drugs, play in a circus
or be a Seeing Eye dog for the
blind, it will do just that.
The intention behind
changing the police from a
“force” to a “service” was to
inculcate the true culture of
Utumishi Kwa Wote in our
officers.
However, the reverse is what
is happening. The police are
out to serve themselves rather
than the public, and this must
change.
Going by the rise in the
number of officers involved in
crime, the last thing we need
is a bunch of people with no
legal mandate to maintain
law and order to be armed. If
rogue police officers allegedly
lease out their guns to
criminals, what would prevent
a low-paid private security
guard from selling his?
This _status quo_ leaves us
diving blind into dangerous
waters as far as anti-crime
policy is concerned.
The important thing to do
is tear up the current syllabus
for the police and draw up one
informed by the Constitution.
Police don’t need a change in
uniform but attitude towards
law and order. Secondly,
firearms must be drawn from
the hands of the police and
private guards to minimise
abuse of their use.
Not all police officers,
clearly, qualify to hold a gun —
as demonstrated by runaway
extrajudicial killings and, now,
armed robbery by the police.
It is time we used common
sense in policing matters.

he public is increasingly getting disillusioned over the
government’s commitment to fighting corruption. The
〇〇〇

the Directorate of Criminal Investigations and the Ethics and
Anti-Corruption Commission launched an aggressive crusade
to rein in the corrupt, leading to the arrest and prosecution of
several top government officials, including Cabinet secretaries
and principal secretaries. But the fight has stalled. It is only in
recent weeks that we saw renewed efforts to seize corruption
culprits — the latest being the arrest and arraigning in court of
Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko over a Sh357 million corruption case.
Now, the DCI has launched investigation into the suspected
loss of Sh38 billion in the Itare Dam in Nakuru County with a
view to securing arrest and prosecutions. Former Treasury CS
Henry Rotich and Devolution CS Eugene Wamalwa, previously
in charge of the Water portfolio, are in the spotlight and face
investigations over the suspected multi-billion-shilling scandal.
Mr Rotich and his former PS, Dr Kamau Thugge, already face
criminal charges over the Arror and Kimwarer dams scandal.
While acknowledge the new effort, doubts abound over the
outcomes as there is scepticism over the government’s commitment to ending corruption. This is because graft cases never
progress. Several top officials have been seized and arraigned
over corruption but none has been convicted. Nobody has been
jailed or the proceeds of graft seized and returned to the public.
Merely investigating, arresting and charging individuals in court
is not enough. In fact, it has become a circus.
Various explanations have been proffered for the paralysis.
For one, the Executive and the prosecution accuse the courts
of stalling cases by giving spurious injunctions to the accused,
hence derailing the purge. But the Judiciary, particularly Chief
Justice David Maraga, has on several occasions repulsed the
accusations, arguing that the problem is with the prosecution.
He cites hollow corruption cases that lack watertight evidence
to force penalties. Into the mix is political interference.
Whatever the case, the citizens are peeved by the inertia. Worse,
pledges by political leadership are vacuous. Summoning two
ministers and other top government officials for investigation
over the Itare Dam is not enough. What is critical is thorough
investigations to secure incontrovertible evidence to sustain
a charge and conviction in court. At the same time, the DCI,
EACC and the Director of Public Prosecution should follow
up all pending corruption cases and push for their conclusion.

hen Burundi last held a general election in 2015, it
barely survived a fully fledged conflagration. The bone
〇〇〇

creative, if not controversial, interpretation of the constitution
to grant himself a third term that prompted an abortive coup.
Several people lost their lives in the ensuing crackdown. Others, including the Vice-President of the Constitutional Court, Mr
Sylvere Nimpagaritse, fled into exile. Bujumbura soiled relations
with several countries that condemned the administration for
bungling the election and treating opponents with brute force.
Indeed, life has never been the same again with the tiny country
suffering isolation and the President restricting his travels abroad.
Burundi is preparing for another general election next year
and ominous signs are all around. In a recent report by the lobby
Human Rights Watch (HRW), the ruling CNDD-FDD party’s youth
league is said to force citizens to fund the elections. HRW says
members of Imbonerakure were extorting citizens for cash and
food ranging from $5-500 (Sh500-50,000). The government has
denied the claim but its earlier pronouncement that it did not
have enough funds to finance the election and that the citizens
would contribute towards it lends credence to the HRW findings.
Notably, the Imbonerakure have been a thorn in the flesh of
Burundians. They have beaten, tortured and executed suspected
opponents and activists, according to the UN investigations.
President Nkurunziza has said he will not run again but it
would be foolhardy to believe him. Many African leaders have a
knack for clinging on to power.
Nevertheless, he owes it to Burundians to create a peaceful
campaign environment that would birth a free and fair election
and spare the country another round of violence.

resident Uhuru Kenyatta
was absolutely right in
〇〇〇

of interest inherent in
parliamentarians rushing
to court as defence lawyers
for public officers facing
corruption charges.
The President’s remarks
in his Jamhuri Day speech
were seen to have been in
direct reference to Senators
Kipchumba Murkomen
(Elgeyo-Marakwet) and
Mutula Kilonzo, Jr (Makueni),
who were among the gaggle
of lawyers representing
Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko
following his dramatic arrest.
The same would apply to
Siaya Senator James Orengo,
whose high-profile clients
include Deputy Chief Justice
Philomena Mwilu and Migori
Governor Okoth Obado.
With the Senate the
primary oversight body
over county governments,
it would, indeed, be odd if a
governor summoned on audit
queries found amongst his
interlocutors the same lawyer
who is defending him or her in
a theft case in court.
There could be no clearer
instance of conflict of
interest but the President’s
intervention takes on political
hues, coming in the wake of
Mr Sonko’s arrest.
President Kenyatta’s
comments were not actually
specific to lawyers-cumlegislators but he also
mentioned teachers, doctors,
engineers, accountants and
other professionals who take
up public service jobs yet
retain private businesses.
This was, in fact, not some
sudden realisation following



Mr Sonko’s court appearance.
A draft Conflict of Interest
Bill had already been in
circulation. However, what
could have been seen as a
simply another initiative to
beef up the anti-corruption
war by replacing the Public
Officers Ethics Act of 2003
with a stronger law could now
turn into a political duel.
Immediate debate following
the speech indicates that
the whole matter could be
reduced to factional wars in
the governing Jubilee Party
pitting a grouping loyal to
the President against an
insurgency revolving around
Deputy President William
Ruto.
Once the Conflict of Interest
Bill is tabled in Parliament,
the President could find
himself badly exposed if the
well-meaning initiative is
scuttled by the Ruto forces out
to flex their superior numbers.


**Family business**
Another issue that could
come up is fingers pointed at
the President on the fact that
the Kenyatta family’s vast
business interests invariably
include entities that do
business with government.
President Kenyatta may
not directly run the family
enterprises but the Public
Officer Ethics Act, the
proposed Conflict of Interest
law supposed to replace it as
well as the Leadership and
Integrity Act all make it clear
that a public servant and
immediate family must not be
seen to benefit from business
dealings with the government.
There are many instances
where the President, due


〇〇〇
〇〇〇



to actions he may not have
directly influenced, could be
perceived to be in conflict
of interest. This could be in
Brookside Dairies selling
produce to government,
Heritage Hotels hosting
official delegations and
conferences or NAS providing
on-board catering for Kenya
Airways and the Standard
Gauge Railway. Also worth
scrutiny might be the CBANIC bank merger go-ahead
from a ‘friendly’ market
regulator, besides tax waivers.
Same issues would apply if
commercial entities linked to
DP Ruto did business with the
government — like if Weston
Hotel became the preferred
host for his office functions
or Amaco Insurance provided
services to State corporations.
These restrictions,
including curbs on







employment of family
members in state agencies,
diplomatic service or other
government departments,
apply not just to the President
and the Deputy President but
to state and public officers
across the board.
There’s actually not much
in the proposed Bill that is not
already in the existing laws,
as well as the Constitution’s
Chapter 6 that lays out public
officers’ integrity guidelines.
Problem is, the provisions
have been rendered nugatory
by unofficial policy of the
Jubilee government, whose
principals, Mr Kenyatta and
DP Ruto, were first elected
in 2013 on demonstrated
contempt for the leadership
and integrity code.
The import of the new law
will thus not be in novelty
but in whether it will, like
the existing ones, be ignored
by those in power. For the
new law to be meaningful,
the President must make
deliberate steps to ensure
family businesses do not place
him in conflict of interest.
But even before that, he
might have the headache of a
Jubilee revolt in Parliament.
As they are wont to do each
time a big shot is arrested,
the pro-Ruto forces will be
keen to adopt Sonko and cast
him as an innocent victim of
the President’s supposedly
biased anti-corruption war. It
could get messy — even before
we look at the threat of Mr
Sonko’s penchant for releasing
audio and video recording of
private conversations.

errorists have struck once again and visited pain and
anguish on our land. It is too early to determine the full
〇〇〇

recorded killed and many others injured — but clearly it is another
of those horrifying moments in our national psyche when the
security is thoroughly challenged and citizens left traumatised.
We commiserate with the families of those killed and those
injured in the attack at the Dusit complex on Riverside Drive,
Nairobi. At the same time, we commend the efforts by the security
personnel to fight back and rescue the victims. Members of the
public also came out powerfully to support the rescue operations,
demonstrating unity of purpose in the face of adversity.
Despite what happened, we must restate that this latest attack
will not kill our spirit. The designs of the evil doers will not triumph
over good. Neither will it drive a wedge between Kenya and its
friends, neighbours and partners, which is what the perpetrators
of the evil designs seek to achieve. True, Kenya has suffered
immensely from terror attacks but that cannot extinguish the
determination to fight the evil forces.
But this new attack is another reminder that security remains
a critical challenge. We are not out of the woods yet and a lot
must be done to seal the loopholes that allow criminals to get
into the country and inflict pain and death on citizens.
For a while, the country has savoured relative calm and peace.
The last horrendous incident was in 2015, when Al-Shabaab
terrorists attacked Garissa University College and killed 147
people, most of them students. Two years earlier, the same gang
had attacked Westgate Mall in Nairobi, leaving 67 people dead
and tens injured.
Since 1998, when terrorists attacked the US embassy in Nairobi
and killed more than 200 people and injured hundreds others
— simultaneously hitting the US embassy in Dar es Salaam and
inflicting much anguish — Kenya has witnessed a series of invasions that tested our security capacity to the limits.
Kenya is a victim of insecurity in neighbouring Somalia, which
has been a theatre of violent conflicts for nearly three decades
following the overthrow of Mohamed Siad Barre. The lawlessness
in that country, now divided into different territories, has bred
terrorists who have consistently organised cross-border attacks
and retreated to their backyards where they vanish with ease.
It is for this reason that Kenya has been participating in the
joint United Nations and African Union initiative to bring peace to
Somalia. Since 2011, the country has had troops in Somalia under
the auspices of Amisom, locally tagged, “Operation Linda Nchi”,
to fight the militants in their territory and protect our borders.
The operation remains a subject of debate though.
But gains have been realised. The terrorists have been pulped
and tamed. The frequency of incursions has reduced. But, there
have been painful moments. Exactly three years ago, the militants
attacked a Kenya Defence Forces camp at El Adde, in Somalia,
killing tens of our soldiers and injuring many others. This remains
a blot on the history of the peace mission.


**Bizarre coincidence**
Tragically, yesterday’s attack came exactly three years after Al
Adde — an indication that the criminals work with some bizarre
milestones. Just when we thought that things we calm, the gangs
unleashed mayhem. Another coincidence is that, just on Monday,
a Nairobi court ruled that some three people accused playing a
role in the Westgate attack should be committed to trial. One
suspect was, however, freed for lack of evidence.
For Kenyans, the chilling reality is that the attacks are not
ceasing. After every attack, security authorities and the government give assurances of vanquishing the gangs and securing our
borders. But the attacks recur. The question is, for how long will
this continue? After nearly two decades of terrorism experience,
has the country not devised a system to forestall the raids or
devised plans for thrashing the criminals and rescuing captives?
At the heart of the matter is the question of surveillance. The
success of any security system depends on intelligence operations;
ability to detect and prevent criminal activities. Inspector-General of Police Joseph Boinnet stated that the security agencies
managed to guarantee safety over the festive season through
close stakeout that prevented crime. However, what happened
at Riverside shows the security agencies were caught off-guard.
They must intensify its security surveillance locally as they fight
the militants across the border. Time has come when we must
completely exterminate the criminals and secure our territory.

he current issue of
_Sunday Nation_, the
〇〇〇

region in terms of circulation,
has just published the details
of the terms and conditions
of the loan agreements under
which Kenya borrowed money
from China to build the
standard gauge railway.
As you go through the
agreement, the inescapable
conclusion you arrive at is
that people who negotiate
these loans routinely allow
foreigners to tie their fellow
Kenyans to lopsided deals,
even as they give away our
national interests.
Still, the story left out the
most important part of the
deal — the pricing of the
Chinese loan. Truth be told,
we are going to pay these
loans through the teeth
because, while we borrowed
during benign times, we will
repay them in turbulent times.
With trends beginning to
show that the US Fed will
continue to tighten monetary
policy in 2019, all indications
are that we will be finding
ourselves operating in a
hostile international economic
environment defined by
the end of cheap money in
international markets, global
trade wars and Brexit.
Mark you, the loan from
the Chinese is pegged to the
London Inter-Bank Offering
Rate (Libor), which has been
rising steadily ever since we
signed up for the debt in 2014
and the US Fed started raising
interest rates.
But, perhaps, the most
important lesson highlighted
by the _Sunday Nation_
story is the need for extra



transparency on the terms
and conditions of foreign
loans. As things stand, public
disclosures and reporting on
external debt is very poor.
Under the Public Finance
Management Act, the Cabinet
Secretary for The National
Treasury is supposed to
provide to Parliament a report
every four months on all new
loans obtained from outside
Kenya or denominated in a
foreign currency.
It does not happen.
Yet regularity in reporting
and the lack of disclosure of
the terms and conditions of
these loans is but a minor
problem. The quality of the
information on information
which the Treasury publishes
on public debt is so opaque as
to leave huge dark holes.
Indeed, the darkest hole in
terms of public disclosure of
the stock of foreign loans is in
the reporting on loans that are
borrowed by the government
and then extended to
parastatals — the so-called onlent loans.


**Revealing disclosure**
We don’t have a
comprehensive on-lending
policy with clear guidelines
on loan monitoring, recovery,
accounting and reporting the
on-lending activities.
As I was going through the
prospectus we put out for the
London Eurobond borrowing,
I was surprised to discover
a revealing disclosure about
external loans.
This is how the prospectus
purported to disclose the
external loans that were
apparently extended to
parastatals in the energy



sector, and that caught my
attention: “During 2017,
various ministries and
corporations such as the
Ministry of Energy and Kenya
Power entered into a series of
loans with China Exim Bank
amounting to $1.2 billion and
Yuan 3.4 billion.”
It continued: “Such loans
mature between 2030 and
2040 and were to be used for
funding certain infrastructure
and electricity projects.”
Just how vague can
somebody be while reporting
and disclosing such important
information?
And when an external loan
is contracted and on-lent
to a parastatal, shouldn’t it
be reported in its balance
sheet” Shouldn’t it sit on the
books of the government as a
contingent liability when the


〇〇〇
〇〇〇







said parastatal fails to pay the
money?
Parliament should insist on
regular disclosure and tabling
of actual loan agreements
before the National Assembly.
I picked up the latest
disclosure on public debt that
covers up to July 2018.
What you will find there is
generic information derived
from Excel spreadsheets. The
information is not from a
general ledger maintained on
the principles and practices of
double-entry bookkeeping.
Worse, the stock of all
on-lent external debts are
reported by industry —
making it difficult to see even
rudimentary information such
as who the borrower is and the
terms of the borrowing.
We must all the time bear
in mind the fact that, as we
have seen in the case of the
SGR, these external loan
agreements contain conditions
that are hidden in the fine
print but which expose
taxpayers to huge contingent
liabilities.
How did we end up here?
You have to go back to
2014, when the Treasury
sought Parliament’s approval
to increase the ceiling on the
stock of external debt from
$14 billion to $28 billion.
The PFM Act gives
Parliament authority to set
limits, or ceilings, on external
borrowing by the national
government. But by raising
the ceiling, we opened the
floodgates and set the stage
for an unprecedented spike
in commercial loans in the
government’s books.

or the umpteenth time, President Uhuru Kenyatta has
declared that the country is tired of empty politicking and
〇〇〇

There is no way a country can progress when politicians are preoccupied with campaigns. It cannot be that ours is a state where
political lobbying and mobilisation begin right after an election.
Pursuit of political power is not an end itself, but a means
to an end. Those seeking political power should do so on the
grounds that they want to make a difference; stimulate national
development and better lives. If today one was to do an audit of
what the Jubilee administration has done in the past three years
since it came back to power, the verdict would be damning. Few
projects stand out that have been delivered. Corruption and public
theft continue unabated. Living conditions have not improved.
Party leaders and members are engaged in endless battles,
tearing into each other in and outside Parliament. Matters are
made worse by the fact the Opposition, which naturally should
provide checks, has splintered and lost direction. It is more of a
lapdog than a watchdog, leaving citizens on their own. That is why
ridiculous motions now easily sail through Parliament because
no strong voice exists to challenge their validity and veracity.
Arguably, President Kenyatta’s pronouncement does not match
the reality of intention. Politicians in his corner are consumed
every day with schemes and machinations to crush the rival
wing in the party. When Opposition parties are seduced and
brought to the Jubilee court, that is purely politics at play. Plots
to appoint new teams to replace perceived dissenting leaders of
parliamentary committees are nothing but politics.
It is not lost on anyone, for example, that before Covid-19
struck, the Building Bridges Initiative that was borne out of the
Handshake between President Kenyatta and Opposition leader
Raila Odinga had converted itself into a movement, with its
proponents and supporters holding rallies across the country
in what other than in name were political campaigns. Political
temperatures rose and there were fears the outcomes of those
rallies would be terribly divisive. The guns may have gone silent
for now but that is just for a moment.
We see double standards and that is why we call for an honest
conversation on national issues. President Kenyatta needs to
lead from the front. If he wants to cool political temperatures,
then he has to start by containing those in his camp who are
busy with new plots every day. Our argument is that all political
players must tame the rhetoric and serve the public.

everal counties have done quite well in developing health
facilities. There are several state-of-the-art hospitals that
〇〇〇
pital and Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital. The counties have
shown a laudable commitment to taking specialised medical
services closer to the people across the country. But there is a
flip side to this that is not flattering, at all.
Counties have demonstrated unimaginable ineptitude and
incompetence in managing medical personnel, especially doctors and nurses. This is evident in the numerous strikes and
walkouts that have characterised the relationship between the
health workers and the county executives. The fights between the
doctors’ union and the counties over pay, allowances, working
environment, promotions and further training are legion.
Three years ago, there was a doctors’ strike that lasted 100
days and left dozens of patients dead. Another nationwide strike
by nurses followed, also with devastating effects. And now, the
country could be in for another big test following a warning by
the Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists and Dentists Union
over failure by five counties to pay their members their May salaries. This could not have come at a worse time as the country
needs all its health workers to fight the Covid-19 pandemic. The
medical personnel are at the forefront in the fight against the
deadly disease and should not be distracted.
Although the devolution of health services makes sense, counties
lack the capacity to effectively manage this highly specialised
group of workers. The national government should, through the
Ministry of Health, reclaim the medical personnel, especially
doctors, from the management of the counties.

hat are the
implications or
〇〇〇

recent Court of Appeal ruling
on the standard gauge railway
that the construction contract
was procured not only illegally
but unconstitutionally?
In a sense, it is a moot
point as the railway was
completed, commissioned and
has operated for months. Yet
the judgment by the bench of
four judges could carry major
implications for our relations
with China.
You can be sure that the
news of the ruling has been
received with a deep sense
of foreboding and concern,
especially in the corridors
of Exim Bank of China, who
financed the project. China
Road and Bridge Corporation,
the entity that signed the
contracts and built the railway,
has also been left exposed.
Beyond these Chinese
parties, there are broader
policy implications and
questions that the ruling
raises. For instance, does
it now mean that the very
popular arrangement of
attracting foreign financing
through ‘contractor negotiated
loans’, and where projects are
awarded without competitive
bidding, must now be treated
as unconstitutional?
What about the ‘tied
aid’ arrangement, where
participation in tenders
is closed to contractors
from countries that have
lent the money? And those
documents known as MoUs
or commercial contracts that
CSs have been liberally dolling
out to Chines companies even
before funds for the projects



have been budgeted for?
Indeed, MoUs and
commercial contracts are
the vehicles that pave the
way for single-sourced
mega infrastructure projects
such as the SGR. Do these
arrangements have legal
standing following the ruling?
These are pertinent
questions because the SGR
contract was just but one
of the typical ‘contractor
negotiated loan’ deals. Indeed,
the majority of Chinesefunded mega infrastructure
projects are of this type.
But the Chinese are not
alone in giving loans with
conditions that preclude
international competitive
bidding. A good example is the
proposed Nairobi-Mombasa
Express Highway. How did the
American company, Bectel,
come into the scene? Italians,
Israelis and the French have
been playing the same game.


**Carries implications**
The exception I have
seen recently was where an
Indian-funded project in the
electricity sector put out an
open tender on condition that
only Indian contractors bid.
What is my point? It is
that the Court of Appeal’s
declaration that the SGR
contract was illegal and
unconstitutional carries
implications that go beyond
our relations with China. Tied
aid is a reality. By declaring
the SGR contract unlawful and
unconstitutional, the court has
waded into the space where
big money is made.
This is the arena where one
of the most viciously fought
political battles is happening


〇〇〇
〇〇〇



— the opportunity to broker
projects negotiated through
MoUs and commercial
contracts with Chinese

contractors.
Segments within the Jubilee
administration have been at
each other’s throats over a
chance to broker big projects.
It became lucrative to be a
broker or political linkman
for large projects negotiated
through MoUs and dodgy
commercial contracts.
How exactly is the game
played? A Chinese contractor,
with his local allies and
agents, approaches a CS
or parastatal MD to hawk a
project that he has conceived
and that has not been
budgeted for by Parliament.
The contractor comes with
a promise to arrange for
financing.
An MoU is then hurriedly







signed between the contractor
and the CS or parastatal
boss. Then follows a
commercial contract between
the parastatal or its parent
ministry and the contractor.
The contractor goes back to
China to secure a loan for the
project. Finally, the National
Treasury is only invited to
sign financing agreements
with Exim Bank of China. This
way, a new project funded by
the Chinese will have entered
the budget. This is how the
SGR project came about.
Why do the corrupt prefer
the route of introducing
projects through these shady
MoUs and commercial
contracts to the conventional
competitive procurement?
It makes it easy to conspire
with the Chinese to push a
project into the government’s
spending programme even
when it has no money for it.
Secondly, since the deal can
be procured and concluded
without subjecting the project
to international competitive
bidding, the crooks are able to
pad the budgets of the project
with as much backhanders and
kickbacks as they choose.
The telltale signs usually
are in the fact that, in most
cases, contracts for mega
infrastructure projects
will invariably have huge
provisions for massive
advance payments that are
usually paid even before a
spade has been lifted.
Allowing a contractor the
dual role of building an asset
and arranging for its financing
reeks of utter opacity and
corruption.

ontroversy has dogged the
Chinese-built standard


project from day one and is likely
to increase. Another dimension
is evolving, that it could be
subject to increasing holdups if
some of the controversial factors
and resultant conflicts are not
resolved.
A brief overview is in order.
It is correct that the SGR
project is being single-sourced.
However, it is important to
note that the proposed project
was originally subjected to
competitive tendering, which a
European consortium won.
However, for reasons that are
best known to those in decision
making at the time, the tender
was not awarded to the winning
bidder. It should also be noted
that the cost of the tendered
SGR was considerably cheaper
than the one we are getting.
One lesson to be learnt is
that competitive tendering, in
conjunction with strict quality
specifications, is a much
cheaper and more transparent
route. It can also be argued that,
if we had done it for this and
other projects that were singlesourced, our ever-ballooning
international debt would be
significantly lower. One caveat
that must be added is, the
above must be subject to public
scrutiny throughout.
As a going concern, the
Syokimau-Mombasa SGR
route is losing money both on
passengers and commercial
cargo. In short, it is spending

〇〇〇



more money than it is earning
on its day-to-day operations
alone. If one was to include loan
repayments and interest, the
losses would normally result in
most such operations being put
into liquidation. It is also being
subject to abnormally high
expatriate labour, in the form
of more than 5,000 Chinese
workers.
The controversy is now
spreading to the adverse
environmental, health and social
effects of the construction of
the railway in Kibiko, Kisamese
and Ol Choro-Onyore areas of
Kajiado County as the project
gets well into its second phase.
First, the environmental
impact assessment (EIA) for
the section running through
or beside the Nairobi National
Park was a sham. Any EIA has
a strict provision for input and
feedback from all in the affected
areas and the public as provided
for under Regulation 17 of the
Environmental Management
and Coordination Act. If that
was done, a number of concerns
would have arisen prior rather
than during the process.


**Against Constitution**
Another is intrusion into
private property and, indeed,
damage to it. This was not just
a case of the contractor asking
for access to someone’s land
but forced entry — against
a fundamental tenet of the
Constitution. Legal Gazette
Notice 12526 of December
22, 2017 of the government’s


〇〇〇





intention to acquire parcels
of land in Kiambu, Kajiado,
Nakuru and Narok counties
came after the Chinese
Communications Construction
Company (CCCC) had already
started work on some of these
parcels. That often resulted
in works such as geotechnical
survey, beacon placement and
even establishment of access
roads on private land without
the prior consent of the owners.
It is also resulting in a lot of
disturbance to the residents of
those areas, who are subjected
to the dust, noise and vibration
from quarry crushers and
blasting activities. This is
often in tandem with overuse



of roads and bridges by heavy
duty construction vehicles and
inadequate waste management
on the various sites which, in
turn, puts at risk basic public
health safety norms and
requirements for the areas
around them.
Anyone who has come across
the relevant vehicles will attest
to the fact that they are often
driven terrifyingly fast with
scant regard for basic road
safety requirements.
Another major environmental
hazard is the damage to the
hydrological table of the
whole area of Kerarapon and
Kibiko. The tunnelling by the
CCCC encountered significant
water flows and, according
to the Kerarapon Residents
Association, “the contractor’s
action within the tunnel
logically explains the sudden
drop in our water levels at the
springs”.
Efforts to obtain hydrological
or seismology survey reports
have borne little fruit, though
they should be available
for public inspection and
interrogation and are a legal
obligation. Whilst one cannot
argue against some of the more
laudable objectives of the SGR,
the way it has been conducted
— from opaque agreements to
the cost and the work on the
ground — is a dark stain on the
governments at the helm.

oday is the Day of German
Unity, when, 28 years ago,
〇〇〇

forcibly split into West and East
republics, was reunited. The fall
of the Berlin Wall in 1989 led to
the opening of the Communist
regime to international
negotiations on reunification.
It was not brought about
by external forces, but the
citizens, who held peaceful
demonstrations triggered by
bad governance, restriction of
personal liberties, economic
decline and collapse of the
Communist bloc.
The eastern German uprising
reminds us of the fundamental
values of democracy, freedom of
speech and the rule of law that
Kenya and Germany share in
their constitutions.
Personally, I remember
those moments vividly as I
grew up and studied in the
former East Germany. Had it
not been for this shining hour
of democratic resistance and
recovery of civic liberties, I
would most likely not have
joined the Foreign Service and,
ultimately, become the German
Ambassador to Kenya. During



my first weeks in Nairobi, I
have noticed the vibrancy of
Kenyan society, its unique
blend of modern technology
and traditional lifestyles.

the Seoul Olympics gold medal winner, the road to
restoring the glory should start ‘Down Under’. Kenya’s

honed, and leave the sport to the disciplined forces.

he second phase of
the Standard Gauge


which takes the line from
Syokimau to Naivasha through
the Nairobi National Park, is
being railroaded through with
indecent haste.
The SGR project was
negotiated on a governmentto-government basis, which
raises the unhealthy spectre of
opaqueness and poor value for
money. Competitive bidding,
not single-sourcing, should
have taken place.
Even if this project is
important and necessary to
enhance the hub status of our
economy, can one justify the
amount spent or committed and
the dearth of accountability?
The government needs to be
totally upfront about what
collateral has been pledged
and if, in any way, this involves
Mombasa Port.
No sooner have we completed
the first phase than we start
committing more money to
electrify it. We are told that an
additional Sh24 billion will be
borrowed to convert it from
diesel to electric. Why now?
Why not when it was being
constructed? The overall cost
of SGR1 (Miritini to Syokimau)
is in the region of Sh327 billion
($3.2 billion) — excluding
electrification, which will

〇〇〇



obviously rise to Sh355 billion
($3.5 billion). Kenya has been
paying Sh1.6 billion in interest
alone every six months since
2014 and will start repaying the
principal any time at around
Sh14 billion per annum.
And how is SGR1 faring? It
is struggling. Passengers have
to get to Miritini or Syokimau;
so, it is not a seamless trip to
Nairobi or Mombasa. And even
with good passenger numbers,
it is ironical that its revenue
is having a problem paying
its day-to-day running costs
and overheads. In terms of
commercial viability, this is a
bad sign as it has nothing to do
with repaying the loans.
The freight side is even more
questionable. One has to get the
cargo to Miritini or Syokimau
and arrange its onward
connections, all at extra cost.
Even the recent reduction of
rates does not compensate for
its lack of seamlessness.


**Strong arm tactic**
The government has also
resorted to the strong arm
tactic of making the transport
of cargo it controls, or has
influence over, go by SGR.
Surely, this makes the cost of
transporting that cargo more
costly? Does it not amount to
an indirect subsidy? SGR2A
is already running into strong







headwinds. The plan for it to
slice through the park is subject
to increasing controversy and
opposition.
It has also been the subject
of considerable research.
Prof Rodney Van der Ree of
the University of Melbourne,
Australia, says the SGR design
showed seven alignments
that interacted with the park:
Two on the perimeter and five
through it. But “in contrast
to best global practice in
EIA (environmental impact
assessment), no options that
completely avoided the park,
were considered”.



The EIA was inadequate to
the extent of being an open
and shut rushed sham. It failed
the basic criteria of proper
stakeholder consultation.
It appears the result was
pre-determined, which is
tantamount to the process
being a self-fulfilling exercise
devoid of credibility.
Having sat through several
sessions listening to an array
of experts thoroughly trashing
Nema’s EIA of the proposed
Lamu Coal Power Plant, I
would go as far as to say that
this criticism is applicable.
Was the park route picked
because it was the cheapest?
One of the constant issues
that has arisen with the SGR is
that of compensation. Was the
decision made on the basis of
economy and saving costs?
Other questions include why
the segmented approach to
the construction and what the
overall cost of the next phase
will be as well as the funding
and repayment modalities.
The cost factor again is most
pertinent because the route to
Naivasha is a more complicated
construction and will be
costlier. And this is only the
second of four stages.

elicit debate, most of which has
been skewed towards finding
the person most culpable.
Interestingly, ongoing
investigations have unearthed
fault lines within the health
profession with doctors rallying
behind “one of their own” and
passing the buck to the nurses
and the hospital’s management.
Predictably, the doctors’
regulator, Kenya Medical
Practitioners and Dentists
Board (KMPDB), unequivocally
laid blame on the duty nurse.
The parliamentary committee
investigation should have gone
beyond the fault lines and
established the root causes of
such a catastrophic medical
error to avoid a recurrence.
Cases of surgical errors
involving medical registrars
and their mentors have been a
subject of empirical research.
In 1979, sociologist Charles
Bosk published the results of
a study in a teaching hospital
of the behaviour by surgical
residents and their seniors.
The study focused on the
identification and management
of error, which culminated in
publication of a book titled,
_Forgive and Remember_ .
Errors are forgiven if they are


〇〇〇





remembered and not repeated.
Bosk’s research findings should
be extended to all healthcare
professionals and organisations
in acknowledging errors and
remembering not to repeat
them.
The healthcare profession is
built on the principle, “First, do
no harm”. This requires utmost
care before undertaking any
medical procedure. But despite
guidelines on preoperative
procedures, medical errors still
threaten patient safety.
Thousands of deaths occur
annually due to preventable
medical errors — which may



happen deliberately or out of
negligence. The key lesson
when they occur is not to shift
blame, but learn from them.
The political, professional
and social angle this case has
taken demands a closer look at
KNH’s patient safety culture.
Admittedly, KNH has an
organisational responsibility
to ensure safety of patients.
Aspects such as values,
attitudes, perceptions,
competencies and patterns of
behaviour of the teams and
individuals (nurses, doctors)
will bring out some insights as
to what needs to be changed.
KNH must also acknowledge
its patient safety problem and
provide open communication
and support systems for
employees, managers and
patients. The outcome of
the inquiry notwithstanding,
blaming an individual will not
prevent errors from recurring.


**System failures**
Fundamentally, we need to
retool our conceptualisation
of the sources of mistakes
from blaming individuals to
analysing system failures.
System-based mistakes such
as decisions that lead to understaffing, excessive workload
or long working hours may lie
dormant in the system for some



time but only become active
under certain circumstances.
In particular, there is a need to
review patient identification.
Procedurally, first, the
patient should have had an
identification band at the point
of admission. Second, patient
identification should have
happened at the shift handover.
Third, authentication of the
patient’s identity should have
happened during handover
from the admitting surgeon to
the operating surgeon. Lastly,
this should have been replicated
when obtaining consent for
anesthesia and surgery.
Surely, all these protocols
were not breached by a nurse!
We need a culture change in
the healthcare system that lays
more emphasis on teamwork
between the doctors and nurses
rather than the silo mentality
seemingly at play. We see blame
games along professional
lines instead of collective
responsibility by doctors,
nurses and management.
Perhaps, this error has
opened up a whole research
field that the government
should consider for funding.

o mark the 70th
anniversary of the
〇〇〇

China, Beijing put on display a
mix of spectacular ceremonial
activities and military parades.
Beyond sending a message that
China was no longer a military
pushover, observers were
impressed by the unheralded
social and economic successes
of the communist republic.
In a few decades, pragmatic
government policies and
interventions have lifted close to
a billion people out of poverty
and eradicated extreme poverty.
Africa, the poster child
of destitution, should find
inspiration in China’s
transformation from an
overpopulated, povertystricken Third World nation
to the second-most powerful
one. Western scholars and
institutions that have long
championed the superiority
of democracy and private
sector-led growth are at pains
understanding this.
Evidently, democracy is
overrated, particularly as a
determinant of social and
economic prosperity and
inclusion. Throughout the 1980s
and ’90s, African nations were
forced into adopting Westernstyle democracy with term
limits and competitive elections.
However, this may have been a



worthless arm-twisting exercise
since the socioeconomic wellbeing in the compliant countries
is not any better than in the
“autocratic” regimes.
Regulation of business
activity is the uncontested
role of the State, yet the target
beneficiaries are remarkably
different for the capitalist West
and the communist China. Since
the Reagan administration,
which lasted the entire 1980s,
the US government has
increasingly undertaken reforms
and regulations that advance
cost-saving, efficiency and
inherently benefit corporations
more than the American people.


**Massive tax breaks**
Whereas taxes are steadily
raised on the people,
corporations and their wealthy
owners enjoy massive tax
breaks. As a result, public
schools and municipalities are
starved of critical cash.
President Trump has
repeatedly acknowledged that
America’s core infrastructure is
dilapidated and risk collapsing,
yet his administration remains
beholden to big business. The
decay continues unabated.
In contrast, communist China
is focused on delivering equity
and has found a formula for a
healthy mix of capitalism and
socialism. State regulation and



spending is in favour of the
collective many.
The number of dollar
billionaires and entrepreneurs
on mainland China is on the
rise yet much of the economic
activity is steered by the State.
In China, benefits generated by
the system are shared, or, as
they say, the economic tide lifts
every boat, not a select few.
Equity, it appears, is a major
consideration in Chinese
overseas dealings. Compared to
industrialised nations, Beijing’s
development cooperation is
less discriminatory. China is
spending massive resources
in critical infrastructure
and productive capacities in
countries long bypassed by


〇〇〇





global financial systems.
Virtually all advanced
nations achieved economic
transformation by being selfcentric. Instead of lifting
other nations along the way,
they exploited, colonised and
occupied them. In contrast,
Africa’s ongoing revival is,
undoubtedly, tied to Beijing’s
activities.
Shall we continue
implementing Western dictates
on democracy and governance
or forge independent pathways
that are quintessentially
African and responsive to our
uniqueness as a people?
By cancelling and scaling
down the dams in ElgeyoMarakwet, President Kenyatta
chose efficiency over equity
— a decision likely to have
serious long-term ramifications
for communities historically
marginalised and isolated from
national development.
On the basis of equity, arid
and semi-arid communities
deserve their dams and more.
Anything else would simply
leave them stuck in abject
poverty even as other regions
get superhighways, universities,
the SGR and industrial parks.

robably since only
cases of prominent
〇〇〇

cancer get the limelight, there
is a misconception that it is a
disease for the rich and affluent.
Far from it. Statistics indicate
that even the poor are not safe
from the spectre of cancer —
only that, for their lowly social
status, most of them could
have been misdiagnosed and
perished without the true cause
of death being established.
Shadowed by concerted
efforts to fight HIV/Aids, cancer
has stealthily emerged as the
next big killer in Africa.
Let the government grasp
the nettle and tackle this
gruesome killer head on. First,
the prohibitive cost of diagnosis
and treatment is a major
hurdle. There is an urgent need
for working cancer screening
facilities, and qualified
personnel, in all the 47 counties
as well as a national cancer fund
which should cover, among
other things, subsidised cancer
diagnosis and treatment.

**SLOTH.** Following his recent visit to the Lands office in
Kiambu Town, Henry Ruhiu says, he was convinced that the
common talk about the staff being on a go-slow has a big
element of truth about it. The service delivery by the officials
is so wanting that he hopes the county authorities will begin
to take an interest in it and quickly streamline the situation.
Henry arrived at the Lands office early in the morning but
it was not until midday that a clerk came into the counter
and, after serving only two people, broke for lunch. “Our
complaints fell on deaf ears as there was no supervisor. Who
will come to the rescue of the people seeking vital services?”
His contact is henryruhiu@yahoo.com.


**DEATH HOLE.** Nearly two years ago, D. Jasondu
recalls, he raised his concern over a gaping manhole
at the intersection of Mbagathi Way and the road
going to the popular Kenyatta Market in Nairobi,
hoping that the city county authorities would act
promptly to avoid grave accidents at the spot.
“However, nothing has ever been done about it and,
consequently, some concerned locals have been
putting tree branches in the hole to warn road users
about it.” This huge manhole poses a major risk
to the road users, especially at night, he adds. His
contact is jasondu19@yahoo.com.


**WASHROOM DILEMMA.** A proud father of some nice
little girls, Mwangi Wanjohi, says that he has always had
some awkward moments whenever he goes out with them
in Nairobi and they need to go to the toilet. “I would like to
know whether there are any shopping malls in the city with
special washrooms for ‘girls in the company of their dads’ or
‘boys in the company of their mums’. I am always confused
whenever my daughters want to use these essential facilities.
Do I just walk into the women’s washrooms with them or do
I take my girls to the men’s toilets? I have faced this dilemma
even in a shopping mall as modern as Two Rivers.” His
contact is wanjohimwangi@yahoo.com.


**BITTER SUGAR.** Some western Kenya politicians
have a big hand in the ailing Mumias Sugar
Company’s woes, charges Edward Wekesa. It was
hardly surprising when some of the MPs from the
region absented themselves from a crucial vote
in the National Assembly on the sugar industry
in August last year. “This report was eventually
debated and mutilated, with some key names being
purged. The national sugar industry’s problems
have been made worse by these politicians, most
likely at the behest of some well-known sugar
importers.” His contact is ebwekesa66@gmail.com.

**FOOD BAN.** The arrival of the standard gauge railway
trains plying the Mombasa-Nairobi route has revolutionised
travel between the two major towns but there are still some
serious concerns, remarks Raymond Kiprotich Langat. The
latest is the apparent bid to get travellers to buy food from
the SGR with a ban on passengers carrying their own food.
Badly hit are travellers with health conditions and who need
special food, and children travelling with their parents, who
need to eat every now and then on the train. “Just like the
requirement to transport all cargo on the SGR, which has
since been rescinded by the government, the food ban
should be lifted.” His contact is raymondlangat9@gmail.com.


**PATRIOT.** After her spectacular 3,000 metres
steeplechase victory in the recent IAAF World
Championships in Doha, Beatrice Chepkoech
impressed Kasilon Michael with her superb
handling of the national flag. “She was handed the
flag, which she unfolded and checked to see which
side was black before holding it up correctly in an
ecstatic celebration. The same cannot be said of
some other medal winners, who just unfolded the
flag and wrapped themselves in it. Kudos to golden
girl Beatrice for taking patriotism a notch higher!”
Have a magnificent day, won’t you!

Hospital and Aga Khan
University Hospital reveals
deep financial strain for families
of patients suffering from the
four main strains of cancer:
Cervical, breast, oesophageal
and prostrate.
With the average annual
income of about Sh600,000
for Kenyans, diagnosis and
treatment for the disease for
most Kenyans is a nightmare.
The data is telling: It costs



between Sh172,000 and
Sh759,000 to treat cervical
cancer without surgery in Kenya
and Sh672,000-Sh1.25 million
if one undergoes an operation.
Basic treatment for breast
cancer costs Sh175,000 to
Sh1.89 million and up to Sh2.48
million with surgery such as
lumpectomy or mastectomy.
Breast cancer is, by far, the
most common with about 6,000
women and men diagnosed with
the disease, according to the
2018 Globocan report under the
aegis of the WHO’s Agency for
Research on Cancer (ARC).


**Underlying deficiency**
A report by Dr Alice Musibi,
of Kemri, says while cancer
treatment in the developed
world has improved immensely,
the same cannot be said of
Third World countries. It cites
testicular cancer, virtually
lethal a few decades ago but
not anymore in the latter. In
Kenya, such medical advances
are yet to be realised owing
to an underlying deficiency of
resources and trained personnel.
There are more cancer cases
being reported in Kenya than



10 years ago. According to a
report by Cathleen Blanchard,
of the American Cancer Society
(ACS), the incidences of cancer
in Africa have been on the rise
yet received little attention from
the public health practitioners.
“The Gobal Cancer Facts and
Figures” points out that cancer
in Africa has been receiving
little attention from public
health officials because of the
high prevalence of HIV/Aids,
malaria and tuberculosis cases.
The “Global Youth Tobacco
Survey” indicates that more
youths than adults in Africa
smoke, exposing them to
tobacco-related cancers. It
warns that cancer cases in
Africa are likely to double by
2030 and projects a sharp
increase in global cancer cases
from 10 million in 2000 to more
than 15 million in 2020.
This calls for governments,
physicians and health educators
at all levels to help the people
to change their behaviour and
avoid these preventable cancers.

up or stifles the expansion of
the economies of Kenya and
its neighbours. Despite the
inefficiencies often reported
about its operations — from
congestion to slowness by
Kenya Ports Authority and
other agencies supposed to
facilitate movement of cargo —
its modernisation is driving up
prospects for efficiency.
A unique and historic
achievement reported by KPA
should be the norm. In June, a
Liberian ship offloaded 3,872
TEUs (twenty-foot equivalent
containers) in under eight
hours. That’s speed of 140 gross
moves an hour, compared to an
average of 40 gross moves an
hour for all ships.
Efficiency is a key driver of
the competitiveness of port
operations and KPA should
focus on attracting more global
business. Now that it has
engaged Marine and Business
Solutions, a Rotterdam-based
Dutch firm, to advise it on a
master plan for the development
of eight small ports under KPA’s
management, there’s no better
comparator on efficiency than
the Port of Rotterdam.
Rotterdam, Europe’s largest
port, with an annual cargo
turnover of 470 million tonnes,
is rated by the World Economic
Forum as the most efficient. Its
undisputed lead on efficiency
for six consecutive years has

〇〇〇



boosted the Netherlands’
ranking as the first on quality
of port infrastructure in the
WEF Global Competitiveness
Index. The country scored 6.8
out of seven points, ahead of
Singapore (6.7) and Hong Kong
(6.5), in the 2017-2018 index.
Mombasa Port is much
smaller. Its annual turnover
is just 30 million tonnes but
increasing. Kenya’s score of
4.5 on the WEF scale ranks it
at 55 out of 137 countries. It is
significant, considering that it’s
just behind giants China and
Luxembourg (both scored at
4.6) and on a par with Jordan,
Greece, the Seychelles, Turkey,
Switzerland and Sri Lanka.
Kenya is ranked fifth in Africa
after Namibia, Morocco, South
Africa and Egypt.
The more inspiring outcome
of the survey is that Kenya’s
score is improving. Presumably,
the port infrastructure managed
by KPA is producing better
results and ships discharging
and loading cargo at greater
speed than before.


**Important lesson**
An important lesson for
Kenya is how to transform
Mombasa into the most
efficient port in Africa, just as
the Netherlands has turned
Rotterdam into Europe’s best
port connection. Efficiency and
sustainable energy use are key
to Rotterdam’s leadership in
a world of shipping logistics
increasingly dominated by


〇〇〇





China and the ‘Asian Tigers’.
For four decades since 1962,
Rotterdam was the world’s
busiest port, but it has been
dethroned by the rapidly
growing Asian ports, including
Singapore and Shanghai, now
the busiest and getting busier.
Rotterdam’s efficiency is
driven by huge investments in
innovation and technological
solutions that have transformed
it into a smart port — where
more technology and less
people drive the logistics.
Intelligent, computer-based
systems load and offload
containers, stack them in
designated parking lots and
move them around the port



with precision. With 30,000
ships calling on the port yearly,
that gives it a powerful edge.
The Dutch experience
offers best practice lessons
to KPA on how to develop a
highly integrated and efficient
futuristic infrastructure that
interconnects the ports with
other transport systems —
including the standard gauge
railway, the Northern Corridor,
inland container depots and
inland waterways.
Mombasa and the upcoming
ports, including Lamu, should
lead on efficiency to remain
competitive in the cut-throat
competition for shipping
business from region — such
as Dar es Salaam and Djibouti,
which is becoming a powerful
player following a major
modernisation and expansion
programme funded by China.
Differentiating KPA’s business
model through efficiency would
improve the preparedness of
the port infrastructure network
to support the growth of
Kenya and the East African
Community, particularly with
the emergence of new industries
in oil and natural resources.
Highly integrated, efficient
and sustainable business
process at Mombasa and
the other ports should fuel
economic growth and social
transformation.

The Geneva Declaration on the
Rights of the Child. Juveniles’
actions or omissions mirror the
society. It would be a justified
cause for tantrums to move from
a rosy cradle to a school saddle
with rules and routine.
But that is no justification
for a child to commit a crime.
School has, for ages, been
deemed a safe haven for
children. Not anymore, based on
the current illegal happenings
and threats perpetrated by both
the teachers and pupils.
In light of recent incidents
such as rape, a schoolboy’s
genitalia damaged by corporal
punishment, a child dying from
being caned, schoolchildren’s
disappearance and numerous
strikes, assaults and arson, and
with several children’s trials
looming due to student unrest,
this tide of lawlessness should
be stopped.
The Constitution, at Article
53(1)(f), provides that a child
should not be detained except
as a measure of last resort and,
when detained, be held for the
shortest appropriate period



separate from adults and in
conditions that take account
of its gender and age. Article
53(2) stipulates that a child’s
best interests are of paramount
importance in every matter
concerning the child.

governors “want deputies without ambition, who will

juvenile justice, capacity is not
an element of criminal liability
but forms part of the culpability.
However, age is fundamental.
The Penal Code places
criminal liability from age
eight; however, this is often
criticised because in most
international laws, it is 12. The
UN Standard Minimum Rules
for Administration of Juvenile
Justice Rule 4.1 states that
the beginning of the age for
criminal liability ought not to
be placed too low an age level,
considering the mental and
intellectual faculty development.



at Section 14(2), also sets age of
criminal liability at 12 years.
Children’s Courts are
mandated to hear charges
against children except for
those on murder or where a
child has been charged with an
adult. Children aged 12 years
and above may be tried as
adults for grave and heinous
crimes knowingly planned and
committed by.
Courts are guided by three
major principles in children’s
cases: The best interest, nondiscrimination and maximum
survival and development
principle.
Juveniles are more capable
of change than adults and
their actions are less likely to
be evidence of “irretrievably
depraved character”.
Pre-juvenile preventive action
with a pro-active approach is
the way to go. Children should
be advised that a crime once
committed cannot be undone.
Suspicious growing children
should be isolated and be given
special guidance, education and
care for their reformation.



**Capacity to understand**
If a child below eight years
performs an act or omission,
which, by law, is defined as a
crime — such as stealing or
killing a person — it cannot
be held responsible for it.
Commendably, the Sexual
Offences Act places liability
to sexual offences and carnal
knowledge offences at 12 years.
If prosecution can establish
that a child of eight-12 years
had the capacity to understand
the consequences of acts or
omission, then the child will be
prosecuted. The Children’s Act,

Chinese funds to extend the
standard gauge railway from
Naivasha to Kisumu, but highly
placed diplomatic sources say
the embarrassment shows the
President may not be receiving
sound advice from his top
diplomats, economists and
other technical experts.
Yes, there is a need to
upgrade our dilapidated railway
infrastructure; yet no one
thought the Chinese-funded
SGR from Mombasa to Nairobi
would be among the costliest
— at $7 million (Sh700 million)
per kilometre on average.
For their electrified rail,
Ethiopians paid $4.5 million
per kilometre, Nigerians $4.6
million for the Abuja-Kaduna
line and Tanzanians $4 million
for the Dar es Salaam-Morogoro
line being developed by a
Turkish company.
Evidently, Kenya’s biggest
infrastructure project in our
lifetime may not have benefited
from honest benchmarking or
unbiased study. But Nzioka
Waita, chief of staff at State
House, contradicted the
President on transparency and
accountability by asserting that
the relevant documents cannot
be made public for scrutiny.
And the issue is garnering



global attention. Some view this
flagship project as an epitome
of corruption and incompetence.
The exorbitant Phase I price
tag is cited as an example of the
predatory lending practices used
by China to fleece developing
countries that lack the capacity
to negotiate and oversee large
infrastructure projects. The
120km extension to Naivasha
comes at a staggering $12.5
million per kilometre while
the Kisumu extension would
have cost even more — at an
unjustifiable $13.6 million!
It is incredible that our
government would seek, in good
faith, a contract for a project
costing three times its value.
Besides the difficulty of coming
up with suitable collateral to
secure the loan, the Chinese
may have found it difficult to
make such a costly investment
in a project of low returns.


**Strategic investment**
In the context of the Belt
and Road Initiative, our
SGR is not merely a national
railroad. Like its antiquated
colonial precursor, the metre
gauge railway, it is supposed
to link the port of Mombasa
to the interior of Africa. It is a
strategic investment for a China
seeking commercial, economic
and political interests in Africa.
Had Kenya, Uganda, Burundi,


〇〇〇





Rwanda, South Sudan and
DR Congo negotiated jointly
under the auspices of, say, the
Northern Corridor Transit
and Transport Coordination
Authority, they could have
extracted, in a win-win
arrangement, a modern railroad
from Beijing at a minimal cost.
Instead of viewing it as a
critical infrastructure meant to
connect people and commercial
centres, Kenya’s political elites
saw opportunities for rent
seeking and adopted a narrow
focus. They inflated costs,
invented land scams and sought
grandiose train stations where
simple platforms could have



sufficed — like what is being
built in Suswa or Maai Mahiu.
The government may have
offended the Chinese (and
Ugandans) by unilaterally
rerouting a centrepiece of BRI
in Eastern Africa away from
the commercially viable and
populous towns of Nakuru,
Eldoret and Bungoma to the
sparsely settled Narok. The
former are interested in tapping
into the wealth and minerals of
Congo, not what Kisumu offers.
Aware of the fraudulent deals
on the Mombasa-Nairobi line,
Beijing probably also questioned
the need for funds to acquire
land when there was enough
wayleave to Malaba.
It is often said that the
Chinese may be corrupt but by
no means foolish. By denying
Kenya funds to implement a
grossly inflated and poorly
conceived project, Beijing has
projected itself as an emerging
superpower that is both
responsible and pragmatic.
China attaches great
importance to its reputation
as the global player capable
of delivering complex
infrastructure at the lowest cost.
Our projects dent that image.

urrent government plans
on shipping and the
〇〇〇

immediate review of the 2009
Merchant Shipping Act.
A clause in the Act blocks
foreign shipping lines from
engaging in other businesses
and confines them to cargo
haulage — and that has been the
case for the past 10 years that
the law has been in effect.
There is a need to repeal or
amend the draconian Act and
come up with a Cabotage Law.
Cabotage by merchant ships
is prohibited in most countries
that have a coastline. The aim
is to protect the domestic
shipping industry from
foreign competition, preserve
domestically owned shipping
infrastructure for national
security purposes and ensure
safety in congested territorial
waters.
The purpose of Section 16
of the Merchant Shipping
Act is to allow “local talents/
entrepreneurs” to venture
into these jobs/businesses
of providing services to ship
owners — both local and foreign
— while barring outsiders
from setting camp in Kenya



**PRISON REFORMS.** As former Vice-President Moody
Awori, “Uncle Moody”, enjoys his retirement from politics,
Mwangi Karuga says, he will always be remembered by many
fellow Kenyans for the major reforms that he spearheaded
to help improve the conditions in the country’s prisons.
With Uncle Moody now out of the limelight, Mwangi is
disappointed that nobody has come forward to take up the
mantle and continue to drive the prison reform agenda. He
adds: “There is no other senior personality who has led the
docket with the same zeal as that which the then-VP showed
to improve the welfare of prisoners and enhance their
rehabilitation.” His contact is mwangikaruga8@gmail.com.


**MOURNING P1.** Part of the collateral damage from
education reforms, including the new curriculum,
will be P1 teachers, Joe Musyoki notes. The P1s
“have been the mainstay of the country’s primary
education system since colonial days, rightly held
in awe in the villages, second only to the priest or
exorcist”. A P1 certificate holder only needed to
clear their throat to silence real or imagined critics,
he says, adding: “Arguably the ‘Recce Squad’ or
‘Formula 1’ of primary education, P1 will sorely be
missed in Kenya and elsewhere where it’s still in
high demand.” His contact is joeaffli@gmail.com.


**RECKLESS LOT.** Truck drivers in Nairobi are a reckless lot
who behave as if they are a law unto themselves, moans
Diana D’Souza. A regular crusader for order, cleanliness and
efficiency in the capital, Diana reports that the trucks are
often driven at breakneck speeds, oblivious of the danger
they pose to other motorists, as they emerge from interior
roads and sometimes even jump the red light. “What
happened to the speed governors? The government just has
to use the security cameras mounted at great cost to the
country to catch these errant drivers. Pedestrians, too, are a
big danger to themselves as they recklessly cross the roads
at any point.” Her contact is diana@encompas.co.ke.


**CORRUPT CHRISTIANS.** As he reflects on the
runaway corruption, especially in the public sector,
Michael Hatego, writing from the border town of
Busia, has been trying to figure out just who is to
blame for the menace. And what has attracted his
attention is a statistic that is often bandied around.
Says he: “We are often told that Kenya is 80 per
cent Christian. That can only mean that 80 per cent
of the corruption in the country is perpetrated by
Christians.” He challenges the Christian clergy to
dissuade this large portion of the population from
the vice. His contact is michaelhatego@yahoo.co.uk.


Former Vice-President Moody Awori launches his
autobiography, _Riding on a Tiger_, in Nairobi in 2017.


**NOISY NEIGHBOURS.** Badly in need of an urgent
lesson in good neighbourliness, is this nightclub in Kibera,
Nairobi, near the railway, says Rose Wambui, accusing the
entertainment joint of causing sleepless nights for residents.
The noisy nuisance, she adds, is also felt all the way to the
nearby Magiwa Estate. Rose wonders why the city county
leadership has allowed the blatant impunity to continue,
shattering the peace at night. She hopes county officials and
possibly the National Environment Management Authority
will do something about the irritant in residential areas. Her
contact is rosewambu70@gmail.com.


**SPECIAL CHILDREN.** The greatest display of
motherly love as Mother’s Day was marked, Chris
Kiriba says, was in the moving _Daily Nation_ story
about Susan Shimba. Her love for her child with
cerebral palsy, and an adopted one at that, really
moved Chris, who says it’s pretty rare these days
“when many people have become so merciless.
Those of us who are trainers of the teachers who
teach these children can only imagine what Susan
goes through.” He believes Susan would make a
good counsellor for parents of children with special
needs. His contact is chriskiriba14@gmail.com.

Have an admirable day, won’t you!

such operations.
But then, how many Kenyanor Tanzanian-flagged coastal
vessels can take part in these
operations?
There is a need to support the
blue economy implementation
team in its bid to revitalise
the Kenya National Shipping
Line and, hence, create jobs for
seafarers and other unemployed
youth, especially in the coastal
region.
The President has a political
and moral responsibility to
effect plans for harnessing
local national resources and
ensure they are organised in
a manner that advances the
social and economic well-being
of all citizens. Indeed, it is a
constitutional duty.
This responsibility is more
critical to coast residents,
who have for many years been
marginalised, resulting in high
poverty levels and massive
unemployment. This has caused
a social crisis in the form of
violent extremism, drug abuse,
radicalisation and hopelessness.

to provide services that can
otherwise be offered by locals.
A change in the law, however,
should take into consideration
the realities and dynamics in
the maritime world.
One is that shipowners
nowadays do not necessarily
operate their own vessels. They
“outsource” many services —
including technical management
(such as superintendence),
commercial management
(shipbrokers and supercargoes),



crew management (crewing
agencies) and bunker supply.
A typical shipping line will
have a very small office in, say,
the UK, a technical management
service office in Hong Kong,
a crewing office in Manila, a
commercial management office
in New York and a bunker
supply office in Singapore.
The shipowner will then
concentrate on trading his own
assets (the ships) or chartered
assets on the lucrative trade
routes. He will be dealing with
bankers, shipbuilders, insurers
and other stakeholders.


**Complicated question**
The question of cabotage
is a complicated one since
the East African Community
Customs Management Act
2004/2009/2011 (as amended)
is interpreted differently by
Kenya and Tanzania, leaving
foreign shipowners baffled.
For instance, the Kenyan
coast does not have safe and
sheltered anchorages for
transshipment, and that has
to be carried out within the
port limits. On the other hand,
Tanzania and Mozambique
allow their coast to be used for"

ith its diversified
economy, tech-savvy
〇〇〇

and strong information and
communications infrastructure,
Kenya’s potential of becoming
industrialised by 2030, as per
its vision, is unmatched in subSaharan Africa.
Newly independent Kenya’s
manufacturing sector recorded
laudable momentum. But the
impetus died off, ushering
in a progressively sluggish
performance. The contribution
of manufacturing to the gross
domestic product (GDP) in
2015 was on a par with 1965.
To return manufacturing to
the growth path, the following
five action points are critical:
First, political leadership
needs to step up legislative
and policy support for the
sector to take a different and
more desirable direction. The
government needs to enact
laws that attract and guarantee
investors a stable operating
environment.
Fiscal policies, for instance,
need to be streamlined between
the national and county
governments to prevent double
taxation. Besides, unnecessary
burdening of investors with
endless taxes and levies can
only dampen their spirit. A
glance at market analyses and
research can easily make many

〇〇〇



a would-be investor shy away.
Laws and policies must
also offer protection to
manufacturers’ intellectual
property rights and create
powerful enforcement
regulations against counterfeits.
Secondly, guarantee a market
for Kenyan products locally
and abroad. President Uhuru
Kenyatta’s last Jamhuri Day
speech directed manufacturers
of leather products for the
uniformed forces to buy hides
and skins locally. And all these
will, from the next financial
year, be locally manufactured.
The directive will not only
drive the “Buy Kenya, Build
Kenya” initiative but also build
local capacity for exports.


**Expanded export share**
Having adopted building a
self-sustaining export-oriented
industrial sector as an anchor
policy to boost industrial
growth, there is a need for the
government to lobby for an
expanded export share within
the EAC, EU and Agoa and
other markets. It should also
seek new agreements for its
diversified product offering.
While agriculture is the
backbone of the economy, we
are yet to fully reap benefits
from it. We need to enhance
agro-processing, whose output
stands at a pitiful 16 per cent.



That would create tens of
thousands of jobs, translating
into billions of shillings.
The third essential lifeline is
infrastructure. Transport and
energy are critical to industries.
Amid commendable strides in
building roads, airports and
railways, reliable and affordable
energy is still a challenge.
Kenya has one of the highest
electricity prices and, sadly,
number of power outages
regionally on a monthly
scale. The outages place
manufacturers at a crossroads,
where they have to make the
difficult choice of suffering idle
time or purchasing costly power
generators. Blackouts cause







losses in half-processed goods
worth millions of shillings.
Amid efforts at achieving
sustainable and reliable supply,
halved electricity costs during
off-peak hours (10pm-6am) will
significantly cut production
costs and push the country
towards a 24-hour economy.
Fourth is political stability.
Political tensions and
instability common during the
elections should be addressed.
Businesses avoid countries
where return on investment will
be diminished or obliterated.
Fifth is developed worker
skillset. Modern manufacturers
are leveraging on technology
to drive their production.
Therefore, a worker with the
necessary skills is essential in
guaranteeing increased labour
productivity and innovation.
Our education system has
focused on memorising facts
and formulas and regurgitating
them during exams; hence,
most graduates lack problemsolving and analytical skills.
Manufacturing could be the
doorway to realising the other
three ‘Big Four’ agenda items.

enya’s economic news
was coloured by two
〇〇〇

week: How the State is taking
over from the private sector as
the main driver of the economy
and the ongoing debate about
the bank interest rate capping.
The World Bank revealed
that, in the past four years, the
public sector’s contribution to
the gross domestic product
(GDP) growth has more than
doubled and, conversely, the
private sector’s diminished.
The public sector’s
contribution grew to 2.5
per cent whereas private
enterprise’s declined from 1.1
per cent to 0.7 per cent in an
economy that has been growing
at five per cent-plus per annum.
The government stimulating
the economy or nudging it
in proactive directions is
fine, especially if it uses the
carrot — as opposed to stick
— approach. A good example is
in infrastructure-led growth.
This is a vital — indeed
crucial — factor since Kenya is
the regional economic hub. It is
the major gateway to the fastgrowing economies of Uganda
and Rwanda. To keep its place,
it must improve its overall
transport and communications
infrastructure — the ports,
roads, railways, air traffic,







cross-border points or any of
the inter-related facilities.
Tanzania is improving the
ports of Dar es Salaam, Tanga
and Bagamoyo. In short, we are
facing increased competition.
The catch comes when we
do it in the wrong way. We
spend far too much money
on overpriced projects with a
disproportionately low return.
I have written often about
the SGR project and have no
problem at all with the overall
concept; it’s the opaque way



it was agreed on, the cost and
now the staccato approach to it.
The government is borrowing
heavily for such projects.
Interest and loan repayments
come out of our taxes and often
result in more borrowing. The
SGR project is a significant
component of the increased
government involvement in
economic growth.
The increased government
stake in our economic growth
should obtain good value for
money and not be helping to
crowd out the private sector.
The most dynamic ingredient
in our economic performance
has been the entrepreneurial
drive of the private sector. We
have a rich mix of go-getters in
the formal and informal sectors,
who drive the economy through
thick and thin.


**Resilience of economy**
Observers often commend
the resilience of this economy.
Last year’s two elections and
a severe, prolonged drought
would debilitate an economy for
a while, but it is now picking up,
thanks to the private sector.
What it needs is a better
operating environment. If it is
only contributing around 10 per
cent of economic growth, then
something is wrong. Anyone
who has had to file iTax returns



to KRA recently will know
just how hard it is as their IT
systems stop and start and
stutter along. This all takes a
disproportionate amount of the
private sector’s time.
Another is the current regime
of interest rates cap. Whatever
the noble theory behind it,
it has just not worked. It has
actually denied working capital
to many small and medium
enterprises, the working ants
of the economy, and had the
opposite effect to its objective.
It is one of the causes of the
economic slowdown last year
and among the reasons it is not
picking up faster this year.
The answer to the making
credit cheaper is to create a
more competitive environment
amongst the lenders and
have a stable macro and fiscal
economic environment.
The rate caps must be
amended or at least widened.
The government needs to
have more carefully honed,
focused and less infrastructure
projects and brutally cut back
on its extravagance and waste.
It must also facilitate more
dynamism in the private sector
and stop crowding it out.

n the early stages of its
implementation, the


(SGR) was perceived as any
other grand public investment
that would add to the stock
of infrastructure, improve
transportation and ease the
cost of doing business for the
private sector. The modern
railway system, which has been
glorified and vilified in equal
measure, is entrenching itself
as the nerve centre of shared
industrial growth and economic
prosperity.
Those who see President
Uhuru Kenyatta’s flagship
project as a 472km railway line
on which the Madaraka Express
passenger trains operate
between Nairobi and Mombasa,
are missing the big picture. The
SGR is the transport solution
and experience that has been
missing since the KenyaUganda railway over a century
ago opened up East Africa
by stimulating the growth of
businesses and trading centres
along the Northern Corridor
transport system.
The Kenya Railways project,
which started commercial
operations in May, has
established backward and
forward linkages with the
economy. It will tug along
the manufacturing sector
and stimulate domestic
and international trade.

〇〇〇



Manufacturing, one of the
President’s ‘Big 4’ pillars of
development in his second and
final five-year term, will be the
greatest beneficiary of the SGR.
Though the sector is the engine
of growth, it has suffered for
decades from inefficiencies
at Mombasa Port, which was
until the SGR, the country’s
most important infrastructure
asset. Industries have protested
about the losses they incur
daily at the port, which is
the playground of cartels and
corruption that cripple the
Northern Corridor.


**Potential**
The Kenya Association of
Manufacturers has urged the
government to fix the port
to save industry from heavy
import and export costs that
prevent it from realising its
potential—to increase its
contribution to the economy
from nine to 15 per cent and
create jobs. The prescriptions to
solve problems at the port are
well-documented but they are
not sufficiently administered,
or the dose may be too little to
make a difference.
The government has now
found a solution that creates
an efficient link between the
port and markets. The centre
bolt of this transformation is
the SGR, which is networked
with the inland container depot



in Nairobi and the proposed
dry port in Naivasha. The
expansion and modernisation
of the inland container handling
facility, which the President
launched last Saturday, and the
dry port, will expedite exports
and imports.
The optimisation of the
SGR transport chain is just
beginning to unfold. Imports
no longer need to be cleared
at the port. Containers will be
offloaded from ships to the
SGR and cleared at the ICD
or dry port. Exports cleared
at the two inland facilities will
be transported by train to the
port and loaded on merchant







ships. Manufacturers will be
the biggest beneficiaries as the
cost of cargo transport and
clearance comes down. Benefits
will also come from faster
transfer of cargo through SGR
freight trains that will handle
22 million tons a year. Kenyans
will benefit from the expanded
business opportunities, jobs
and technology upgrading
stimulated by the new system.
The lords of the port sense
serious loss of business and
influence. Taking away a huge
chunk of cargo handling and
Customs clearance services
from the port will reduce
opportunities for rent-seeking
and shift trucking business
inland. Just as Madaraka
Express has significantly
reduced buses on MombasaNairobi highway, the freight
service will cut the number of
trucks plying the corridor and
create opportunities for those
serving the inland ports.
Of the investments that will
define President Kenyatta’s
legacy, the SGR stands out. The
investment has pulled out the
crocodile that has stubbornly
prevented Kenyans from
drinking from the fountain of
growth and crossing the river to
prosperity.

he use of herbicides and
pesticides in developing
〇〇〇

perennial and annual weeds
control measure, is widespread.
The most heavily used
herbicide is glyphosate because
it requires less field preparation
and fewer expenses linked to
farm machinery. In 2011, nearly
650,000 tonnes of glyphosate
products were used worldwide
and this was expected to double
by this year.
In Kenya, although there is
no publicly available data, there
are 28 different glyphosatebased products. They are
applied in tea and coffee
plantations, beans, sugarcane,
barley, and maize. Despite
the economic and ecological
benefits such as soil erosion
prevention, organic matter
loss, water evaporation and
biodiversity, there is a need to
question the effects of the use
of herbicides on human health
and the environment.
In Europe, there has
been heated debate between
scientists, NGOs, governments
and industry in the past two
years on the re-registration of
this active ingredient. Some
argue that glyphosate is likely
to cause cancer and should,
therefore, not be re-registered.
It is an argument that has been



average amount of maize an
average European eats per day.
However, the amount eaten by
a Kenyan in a day is certainly
higher. This means that the
allowed MRL needs to be
adapted to Kenyan eating habits
and might have to be reduced.
Examples in Kenya,
such as the organic coffee
project in Rongo supported
by Permaculture Research
Institute and Biovision, proves
that it is possible to reduce
the use of glyphosate without
any negative economic effects.
After two years of changing
to organic coffee production,
the yield increased from less
than 0.5 to 2.4 kg per tree per
harvest.
Covering soil with mulch and
cover cropping with legumes,
which fix nitrogen from the air,
help to improve soil fertility.
Other possible solutions include
intercropping with nitrogen
fixers such as caliandra, lucern,
pigeon peas, agroforestry,
spraying with a natural product
such as vinegar and digging or
pulling out weeds. We should do
this for the sake of food quality,
our health and environment.

Authority and traffic police over the rising fatal road
accidents won’t help much, remarks Joseph Macharia,
but who is not all surprised at this. What is really
needed, he adds, “is total behavioural change among

GREAT CHANCE. Quite touching, Ken Ogare
notes, is the story of how a chance meeting between
Dr Prabha Choksey and a little eye patient ended up
contributing to the making of this year’s top KCPE

not only treated the girl some years back, but also
heard her mother’s cry about lack of school fees and
offered to sponsor her education. “That philanthropy
has ended up changing the life of the girl and will
certainly make a big difference in her family. How I
wish many of us could emulate the doctor’s example!”

Cancer. Others argue that the
carcinogenic properties have
not been proven conclusively
and that glyphosate should thus
be re-registered. Unfortunately,
glyphosate was on November
27, reregistered for the next
five years. In Kenya, farmers
perceive the use of herbicides
and other pesticides not as
problematic. It’s a perception
that is mainly attributed to
lack of awareness. And where



training is given to farmers, the
emphasis is on personal health
protection equipment.
Monitoring programmes
in Europe and the US show
ecotoxicologically relevant
glyphosate concentrations in
water, urine and food (for beer
and bread), so one can expect
elevated concentrations in
developing countries.
In Kenya, there is no
programme to gather
information on glyphosate
pollution in water, soil and air,
or residue monitoring in food.

A paper by Rockström in
2009 stated that one of the
biggest environmental problems

Environment Assembly in
Nairobi.
Another issue is the
calculation of Maximum
Residue Levels (MRLs) in
food. Very often, the European
MRLs are taken as a guide and
simply adopted for Kenya due
to the need for compliance for
the export market. However,
situations might be very
different. The European

**BY GABRIELLE LYNCH**


n August 8, some 15.6
million Kenyans – or
〇〇〇

voters – turned out to vote in
the country’s General Election.
On August 11, the Independent Electoral and Boundaries
Commission (IEBC) declared
President Uhuru Kenyatta winner of the presidential race with
54 per cent of the vote, a decision that was later overturned
by the Supreme Court in a 4:2
majority ruling.
The reasons for this landmark
decision include the following:
That by failing to transmit presidential results (or forms 34A)
from polling stations; provide all
forms 34A as a means to verify
constituency level results (forms
34B); explain a large number of
anomalies (including the lack of
security features on some forms
34B); and comply with the
court’s ruling to provide access
to the commission’s server and
access logs, the IEBC had failed
to conduct the election in accordance with the Constitution
and relevant laws.
The IEBC initially scheduled
a fresh presidential election for
October 17, but has since pushed
the date to October 26. However,
it is possible that the date will
be moved again.
According to the Constitution,
in the instance of a successful
petition, a fresh election should
be held within 60 days of the
Supreme Court ruling, which in
this case would be October 31.
However, it may come to a
point where it is argued, and
broadly accepted, that more time
is required to ensure that the
election is conducted in accordance with the Constitution.
Whenever the election is
held, the precedent set by the
Supreme Court renders it likely
that whoever loses will petition
the results. This opens the door
to the possibility of a third election.


**Moral high ground**
As Chief Justice David Maraga
noted: “This court, whenever
called upon to adjudicate on a
similar dispute, will reach the
same decision if the anomalies
remain the same, irrespective of
who the aspirants may be”.
But what about the likely
outcome if the election is free
and fair? Significantly, while the
four Supreme Court judges concluded that the August 8 election
was neither transparent nor verifiable, they did not assess the
accuracy of the outcome. The
implication: We do not know
what the exact result was.
Predicting the future is further
complicated by the fact that voting patterns may change.
First, some people may switch
their vote, for example, due to
perceptions about who has the
moral high ground or is likely
to win. Or because of more
local level issues, such as the



The implication
is that it is a
mistake for people
to assume that their
preferred candidate
will win. Ultimately,
the results will depend
on the credibility
of the process, but
also on evaluations
of who is the best
candidate and turnout,
which will depend on
the campaigns and
the messages and
motivations provided.”


influence of politicians who
have switched sides and possible intimidation in Jubilee
and Nasa strongholds to vote
in line with the local majority
or to not vote at all.
This leads to a second, and
likely more important factor,
variations in turnout. On the
one hand, in an increasingly
polarised political environment, turnout may well increase
in some Jubilee and Nasa
strongholds. This is reflected
in ongoing discussions among
local activists about how to
mobilise registered voters who
are known to have stayed home
on August 8.
On the other hand, turnout
may decrease in other places.
On August 8, Kenyans voted
for six elected officials – President, Governor, Senator, Woman
Representative, Member of Parliament and Member of County
Assembly – who all conducted
intense campaigns and sometimes facilitated voters to get
to the polling centres.
Moreover, while the majority
of Kenyans view the presidency
as the most important race,
some are more interested in
lower-level races – such as the
MCA or governorship – and may
feel less motivated to turn out.
This is particularly true for those
who do not feel particularly close
to, or passionate about, either
candidate.
The implication is that it is
a mistake for people to assume
that their preferred candidate
will win. Ultimately, the results
will depend on the credibility
of the process, but also on
evaluations of who is the best
candidate and turnout, which
will depend on the campaigns
and the messages and motivations provided.
If voters have an opinion
about who their next president
should be it is therefore critical
that they turn out to cast their
vote.

turns out that the oil pipeline is
not a priority. What might the
logic be?
Sociologists call this political system the centre-periphery
model of capitalist accumulation.
In centre-periphery capitalism, the
periphery is only seen through the
lens of extraction of natural resources or exploitation of cheap
labour. As long as Turkana, and
the whole of the arid north generally had neither (pastoralists are
notoriously difficult to exploit),
they were left pretty much to their
own devices.
Effective extraction requires
authoritarian political control.
The logic should now be readily
apparent. The 2010 Constitution
has given too much power to the
periphery. The investment must
be put on hold until this constitutional order is dismantled,
and effective political control
re-established.
What we are seeing in effect is
convergence of the international
and domestic centre-periphery
logic. In the face of the counterterrorism imperative and the
Chinese commercial onslaught,
constitutionalism and democracy
in the periphery have become inconvenient.
But this is not new. It harks
back to the Cold War era puppet regimes of Mobutu, Moi and
others. _Plus ça change, plus c’est_
_la même chose_ (The more things
change, the more they stay the
same).
Simply put, we are on our

own.

total foreign debt, and close to
40 per cent inclusive of the SGR
extension to Naivasha.
Since, in the revenue sharing
system I have referred to, servicing debt takes precedence over
county allocation, this uncontrolled borrowing negates the
constitutional imperative. Let
me illustrate.
Suppose in Year Zero of devolution we start with Sh1,000
sharable revenue. The sharing
rule is set at 70:30 for national
and county governments respectively. In the course of the year,
the national government borrows
Sh500 at a 10 per cent interest.
The national government now has
Sh1,200 to spend, which changes
the resource allocation from 70:
30 to 80:20.
The following year, the revenue
to be shared will be less Sh50 annual interest on the debt. If the
revenue remains Sh1,000, the
sharable revenue will fall to 950,
and the county share from Sh300
to Sh285. If this goes on for five
years, the counties revenue share
will be squeezed down to Sh225.
Secondly, the concentration of
investment in the favoured regions



reinforces the development disparities that the constitution has
set out to cure. The motives that
are driving the national government to concentrate infrastructure
on the Northern Corridor at the
expense of LAPSSET are not difficult to discern.
The national government is captive to the owners of capital both
local and international, and this
is where their investments are. It
has emerged that Jubilee administration’s goal was to capture
the four metropolitan counties
Nairobi, Kiambu, Kajiado and
Machakos, create a metropolitan authority controlled by the
national government to which the
county governments would cede
power, leaving the governors as
figureheads.


**Desperate scheme**
Not too long ago, we were
treated to one of Uhuru Kenyatta’s frequent tantrums while
campaigning in Turkana as he was
taken to task for frustrating an oil
revenue sharing legislation. The
monster oil bonanza anticipated
three years ago was a key driver
of the Jubilee administration’s
borrowing binge.
As the prospects of the windfall
faded, how to repay the monies
borrowed and squandered in anticipation has become a headache.
It is this headache that prompted
the desperate scheme to transport
some oil by road all the way to
Mombasa that now appears to
have come a cropper as well.
Remarkably, the cost of the
proposed crude pipeline from
Turkana to Lamu given as US$3b,
is of the same order of magnitude
as the new highway. So even after
all the hubris about going it alone
after losing the Uganda pipeline,
and the “early oil” charade, it now"

tell us — we Kenyans — that
what we are hearing is not
true. Tell us whether indeed
our Mombasa port has been
leveraged for the Sh294
billion China loaned us for the
Standard Gauge Railway. We
want to know the full facts. We
demand complete disclosure.
We have heard of Sri Lanka’s
Hambantota port being seized
by its Chinese creditors when
it failed to repay the lenders.
We know, too, that Djibouti
risks losing its strategic port in
similar circumstances due to
its heavy indebtedness to the
Chinese.
The sketchy information
available is disquieting. A
November statement from the
Auditor-General to Kenya Ports
Authority questioned the loan
arrangement with China Exim
Bank for the construction of the
SGR. The statement suggested
that Kilindini port could have
been put up as collateral for the
SGR loan, implying that Kenya
would lose the port if it defaults
on the loan. This is no laughing
matter. It amounts to putting for
auction not just the family silver,
but the entire farm.
I don’t want to throw
brickbats until all the facts are
clear. Yet the Auditor-General
can’t be raising red flags unless
whatever he has dug up is highly
fishy. Pray, what is wrong with

individuals, liberated our

unconsciously that our
newspaper producers do
it again and again.
For instance, what

was the meaning of the headline “Mt Kenya warms to
opposition” carried on page one of the _Daily Nation_ of
Tuesday, December 18? For it stressed the fact that what
masquerades as political choice in our country is really
nothing but profound tribal subjectivism.
For the Kalenjin, Kamba, Kikuyu, Luhya, Luo and other
large ethnic communities, there is really no question about
it. The President of the Republic of Kenya must and will
always be either a Kamba, a Kikuyu, a Luhya or a Luo
man. I say “man” because each of those and Kenya’s other
ethnic and racial communities is dominated by individuals
whom female liberationists the world over call “male pigs”.
Indeed, so it will always be until Kenya devises a
waterproof method by which to eliminate smallness of the
mind from our political minds.
That statement makes it manifest that Kenya’s president
will always be male and always come from a certain very
large ethnic community.
Of course, he or she may be a properly educated
and good individual. The only problem is that such an
eventuality is never guaranteed.
Our erstwhile Caucasian Euro-North American teachers
always taught us — and, like children — we always
accepted the teaching — that, in a “democracy”, whomever
the human majority votes for is the legitimate and even
the best leader. Yet, of course, the choice is always a he,
a character quite likely to have been reared in a stinking
male pigsty.
However, the statement that a majority — a mere
number (and not anything else) — is the criterion of
good leadership cries out as nonsensical. Shouldn’t it
automatically disqualify ideology and religion as criteria of
legitimacy and even of goodness? Indeed, nobody whom I
have read has ever really posed one manifestly significant
question: How does a mere majority — how does a mere
number confer social goodness on a group of would-be
ruling human beings?
In Kenya, the Kikuyu, a Bantu community, are, by
population, the largest ethnicity. Moreover, as the English
people used to put it, blood is thicker than water.
That is why, in Kenya, other ethnic Bantu communities
are always likely to vote for a Kikuyu or even Giriama or
Luhya candidate, rather than for a Kalenjin, Luo, Maasai or
any other Nilotic candidate.
But how can Kenya rapidly wriggle out of the ugly
conundrums of tribalism and racism? I do not know any
way out except to appeal to the leaders of Kenya’s ethnic
and racial communities to take their own initiatives and
lead their respective ethnic and-racial peoples into a new
national unity of ethnic and racial communities designed
to lead Kenya as rapidly as can be into a single national
whole.
Inter-racial marriages may help. But that is an extremely
subjective choice on which no development planner can
put any premium. It is, nevertheless, an important choice
which leaders should powerfully encourage.



print? The Auditor-General
has since sought to calm the
waters somehow by clarifying
that the initial statement was
not “conclusive,” and that a full
audit report will come when its
queries to KPA are answered
satisfactorily. Why would KPA
have anything to do with SGR
loans, you may ask? Because
the success of the SGR freight
business depends on the
Mombasa port. Trust Kenyan
Twitterati to find dark humour
in the dire circumstances.
Sample this: “What does one
call dockyards in Chinese?”
Whatever way this alarming
story turns out, Kenya’s debt
position has become a matter
of grave concern. Our country’s
debt addiction is tightly tied to
China’s lending. One problem
with computing this debt is that
those doing the figures don’t
always agree. The data given
by foreign risk-assessment
institutions is often disputed
by our own official number
crunchers, who prefer a rosier
picture, hard as it is to get.
Anyway, even if when we go
with the latter’s numbers, the
magnitude of the debt hole we
are currently in is apparent to
all.
Our official statisticians put
Kenya’s Chinese debt at Sh534.1
billion as at March this year.
This amounts to 72 per cent of
the country’s total bilateral debt,
or that share of loans which are
government-to-government.
The SGR loan forms a large
component of this Chinese
debt. The next biggest bilateral
lender — Japan — is far behind
China’s outlay with only Sh91
billion. In fact, Kenya is China’s



third largest debtor in the entire
Sub-Saharan Africa after Angola
and Ethiopia. Note: The other
two countries have higher GDPs
than Kenya’s.
Kenya’s debt to China could
rise sharply again as the country
seeks a further Sh380 billion
to fund the SGR extension
from Naivasha to Kisumu.
During the China-Africa Forum
in Beijing last August, Kenya
sought a grant (as opposed to
commercial credit) to finance 50
per cent of the SGR extension.
The request was denied.
Critics argue that Kenya’s
large debt shows poor
correlation to economic
productivity, mainly due to
corruption. The complaint
against the SGR is that it was
grossly overpriced, compared

to what countries like Morocco
or Ethiopia negotiated for their
railway projects. Chinese loans
are also expensive. Most come
in the form of export credits,
hardly as grants or concessional
loans which are cheaper.
The Central Bank of Kenya
has sought to downplay Kenya’s
indebtedness to China. But it
has only succeeded to show
how our overall indebtedness
is worryingly high. March this
year, CBK put the country’s
total external debt at Sh2.51
trillion, broken down as follows:
Sh832 billion in multilateral
debt (such as from the
World Bank and the African
Development Bank); Sh799
billion in commercial debt;
Sh741bn in bilateral debt; and
Sh140.4 billion in “guaranteed”
debt. The CBK figures put our
exposure to Chinese debts as a
share of external debt at 21.3 per
cent, still a high exposure.
A Treasury Quarterly Report
in June showed our domestic
borrowing, mainly from local
banks and pension funds, had
hit Sh2.4 trillion, very nearly
as high as the external debt.
In total, our overall debt had
reached Sh5 trillion, which is 58
per cent of our GDP. That’s a
precarious ratio.

Chamber of Commerce and
Industry sent a memorandum

the SGR. But seeing as the
Chinese are quite involved in its
day-to-day operations, it is fair
to guess it would grind to a halt.
The matter could go to
international arbitration, which
could be a double-edged sword
for the Chinese, especially as
the Appeal court is clear the
procurement was highly flawed
and fraught with irregularities.
The first thing any arbitrator
would look at is the legalities
and processes regarding the
project’s inception, especially
tendering and procurement.
A third and more
Machiavellian option would
be for the Chinese to leak into
the public domain the details
and figures of the beneficiaries



ast week’s Court of
Appeal ruling that the
〇〇〇

standard gauge railway (SGR)
project was illegal is bold and
welcome. That the venerable
court has given a legal response
to Kenyans’ many doubts
and questions is good for our
country and the justice system.
For a long time, many of us
have questioned the process
and substance of the infamous
— indeed, notorious — SGR
drama. This was an opaque,
lopsided agreement conjured up
behind closed doors between a
self-selected coterie of Kenyan
officials and the Chinese
government and its various
commercial counterparts.
It was so lopsided that
it benefited the China side
enormously, but landed us with
a project of questionable value
at an obscenely ridiculous cost,
which we literally can neither
afford nor sustain.
Besides the massive, arguably
over-inflated, cost of this
untendered turnkey project
is the questionable issue of a
company both getting a contract
to do the construction of the
railway and then running it.
This is most irregular.
The argument for an SGR
project was always valid as
long as it was cost-effective.
But the way we went about



creating this unaffordable and
under-performing monster, is
a veritable blot on President
Kenyatta’s past and current
government and legacy, and our
economic landscape.
So what of its legal
implications? Article 2 (4)
of the Constitution says
very clearly that anything
done in contravention of our
Constitution is null and void.
The SGR contract violated
Articles 227 and 10, making it
null and void. That means it
is not worth even the paper it
is printed on, is unenforceable
and is not legally binding on
us. In short, the government
is not obligated to pay another
shilling and, if it does, it risks a
mountain of domestic outrage
and court cases from Kenyans.


**Negates collateral**
Even more pertinent is that
it invalidates and negates the
clauses about collateral. As
then-Auditor-General Edward
Ouko said, the government
committed Mombasa port as
part of the collateral. So, if the
government defaulted on the
loan, the port could be taken
over. Not anymore.
What recourse does Beijing,
and the concerned companies,
have in this situation in case of
a payment standoff? It could
walk away and let Kenyans run

— so to put it into corruption
parlance. Undoubtedly, the full
details of the relevant bank
transactions and payments are
somewhere. Given the size and
enormity of this Sh500 billion
project, one can conclude that
the kickbacks were considerable.
Whether the government
comes clean on such an issue
or not, the public will be treated
to a galaxy of exposures. And
this could well be the mother of
all scandals. The government,
and China Road and Bridge
Corporation are caught between
a rock and a hard place.
Whichever way, forward or
backward, will be a minefield.
With the project only twothirds finished, for it to fulfil
its ‘dream’ role of being the
seamless link to inland Eastern
Africa, it must get to Uganda
and beyond. But it is marooned
at some waterhole outside
Naivasha.
Maybe the best way to get
the government take its head
out of the sand on this is for
Kenyans of every rank and file
to make it clear to it that it’s no
longer business as usual on the
SGR. After all, we have spent a
fortune on it and it makes sense
to see how we can make it work
and even pay its way in time.

ven with over 130,000
Covid-19 tests done in
〇〇〇

countrywide despite the myriad
constraints, the government has
to urgently increase its capacity
to test, trace and treat patients
while maintaining essential
health services.
While Health ministry’s
infrastructure to communicate
results and manage patients in
in-patient settings is welcome,
there’s a need to escalate mass
testing to reach all Kenyans.
A whole-of-government,
whole-of-society approach to the
Covid-19 response, mobilising
all available resources to keep
health systems functioning, is
necessary. And to have that,
we need a policy framework
for Private Health Sector
Engagement (PSE).
Effective PSE amid the crisis
means having the capacity to
quickly understand what is
going on in the private health
sector, select a fit-for-purpose
fit-for-context strategy to engage
the private health sector as part
of the response, identify and
use the appropriate instruments
for engagement, and involve a
broad range of private providers



of health products and services,
be they NGOs, faith-based
organisations, individual private
practitioners or businesses in
the national response.
Mass testing, which involves
the test-track-and-trace
approach, can allow health
officials to separate the infected
from the healthy and stop the
virus from spreading. The
logic behind mass testing is
suppression — efforts to reduce
the infectivity of a pandemic.
Testing and isolating people



rapid spread of the infections
and fatalities. Delay fuels the
pandemic and causes panic.
Contact tracing was effective
for communicable diseases such
as measles, chicken pox and
sexually transmitted diseases.
While the World Health
Organization advises that
aggressive measures to find,
isolate, test, treat and trace are
the best ways to stop the spread
of this virus, public health
interventions to “flatten the
curve” may slow transmission
and mitigate peak capacity
needs.
A strong biomedical
workforce must be on stand-by
to provide broad testing in
a bid to stop new patients

**RATES WAIVER.** To help alleviate the Covid-19 pandemic
suffering, Wanjiru Thiong’o is proposing that Nairobi City
County consider granting a waiver of interest and penalties
to rate defaulters, “which it has not given for several years”.
Property owners, Wanjiru adds, have been grappling with
poor infrastructure and drainage, acute water shortages
and woeful waste management, among other challenges.
“Rental property has suffered loss of income due to defaults
and many are now unable to service their mortgages and
construction loans. They’re also expected to pay a whopping
Sh10,000 for a clearance certificate that is valid for only three
months.” Her contact is wthiongo474@gmail.com.


**POOR ROADS.** The poor condition of roads in
his rural home in Kirimukuyu Ward of Mathira
Constituency in Nyeri County, says Eutychus
Mutahi, who, incidentally, is kind of a namesake of
Governor Mutahi Kahiga’s, has been troubling him.
Routine maintenance by the Kenya Rural Roads
Authority (Kerra) has been neglected. Kerra, he
recalls, used to hire youths to unblock drains twice
a year and clear bushes. “Most areas have become
inaccessible, especially in the rainy season, while
some roads have been reduced to footpaths by
bushes.” His contact is eutychusmutahi@gmail.com.


**POTHOLE CAPITAL.** Following recent heavy rains in
central Kenya, Richard Kamami reports, the users of the
Thika-Mang’u road have had to contend with huge car repair
costs due to the potholes in the Ngoingwa area. The place,
adds Richard, has also witnessed some nasty road accidents,
and many more are likely to happen, as motorists swerve to
avoid smashing into these deep potholes. He is, therefore,
appealing to the Kenya Urban Roads Authority to come to
his and his neighbours’ rescue and help to prevent accidents.
Alternatively, youth should be engaged to sort out the mess
through the Kazi Mtaani initiative, he pleads. His contact is
richard.kamami@gmail.com.


**MASK IN CAR.** While the Covid-19 pandemic has made
the lives of Kenyans miserable, Munir Noorani
is disappointed that the police are worsening the
situation by needlessly harassing the people. Munir
would like the Health ministry to clarify whether it’s
mandatory to put on a mask while in a family car
and how many people should be carried, as police
officers have been preying on motorists for bribes.
“There is too much extortion going on and it’s quite
frustrating.” The ministry should urgently, at its
daily updates on the virus, address this matter, he
says. His contact is noormunir62@yahoo.com.

**CALLING MATIANG’I.** Also unhappy about the sorry state
of roads is Annah Oruta, a resident of Syokimau, in Machakos
County, right on Nairobi’s eastern outskirts. She is particularly
incensed about the pathetic condition of the 4.5km stretch
of Community Road to Mombasa Road and wishes that the
no-nonsense Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i could
pay one of the capital city’s ‘bedrooms’ a visit. This short
distance, she adds, has become a nightmare for motorists.
According to her, it’s under the national government; hence
her appeal to “super CS Matiang’i” to take action and ease
the people’s suffering. Her contact is aoruta@gmail.com.


**GONE WITH M-PESA.** Something is terribly wrong with
M-Pesa mobile money transfer’s reversal system,
laments John Kivuva. After his wife inadvertently
sent money to the wrong person, she immediately
forwarded the acknowledgement message to short
code 456 in a bid to reverse transfer. She then got
the response that the money would be returned
in two hours. But later, she was informed that the
undeserving recipient had withdrawn it. “Why
have a reversal system that does not work?” asks
John, who suspects collusion between staff and the
recipient. His contact is johnkivuva8@gmail.com.

who are positive seeks to reduce
the R-naught to less than one.
Studies in Wuhan and elsewhere
show that, when unchecked,
the R0 of Covid-19 is between
two and three — meaning every
infected person infects two to
three others.
Besides mass testing in
Kenya being hampered by lack
of testing kits, the biggest
challenge has been contact
tracing, identifying and then
alerting people who have been
within the infection range of a
confirmed positive case.


**Not feasible**
Drawing on private sector
resources and capacity is
critical. In low- and middleincome areas, the private health
sector provides a significant
proportion of essential services

Unfortunately, contact tracing,

he standard gauge railway
(SGR) project is back in
〇〇〇

case, the fatally marred overly
controversial undertaking has
hit the headlines for the wrong
reasons: Its dubious origins and
very chequered operation.
The State Law Office wants a
review and renegotiation of the
operating agreement between
the parastatal Kenya Railways
Corporation (KRC) and Chinese
operator Africa Star Railways.
The thrust of the SolicitorGeneral’s argument is, KRC is
paying over the odds for several
services and non-services
making the SGR’s operating
costs inordinately high.
SGR charges $33 (Sh3,300)
per kilometre per tonne,
whereas the cost by road is
a quarter less. Such a huge
difference makes it very difficult
to convince customers to put
their cargo on SGR.
Taken to its logical extreme, it
totally rubbishes the argument
for both another rail cargo
network and, in particular, the
SGR. Even worse, there is the
burning question of whether
the government has, indeed,
squandered in excess of Sh500
billion on such a project.
The initial intention was
to have a seamless transport
service from Mombasa to the
Ugandan border and beyond,
but which now ignominiously

〇〇〇



terminates at an outpost near
Naivasha called Duka Moja.
The SGR was a governmentto-government turnkey
operation negotiated in a shroud
of opaqueness and dumped
upon the Kenyan population
with the minimum of scrutiny.
It’s no exaggeration to say
it has so far cost twice what
it should have and the quotes
submitted were around half of
what it has cost so far. Why the
government went for a more
expensive non-tendered option
is an open question, which most
Kenyans can easily hazard a
guess at the answer.
It has landed Kenya with a
massive debt, which it’s having
extreme difficulty paying and
servicing, and its actual dayto-day operations run at a loss.
Much of its construction is
steeped in controversy, not least
the fact that it cuts through our
iconic Nairobi National Park
instead of going around it.


**Non-existent projections**
The Solicitor-General is
questioning costs and charges,
which were premised on the
wrong projections. Worse, Africa
Star charges for things it does
not actually do, like non-existent
operations on the Phase 2A line.
But how did Kenya end up
with such a monumentally
defective deal and project that
costs a fortune and lacerates



money right, left and centre.
The SGR gets a lot of
publicity as it is as gargantuan
as it’s high-profile. How many
more projects, often in the
name of development, litter
our economic landscape and
bleed us of money? How many
less would there be had the
proposals been subjected to the
relevant financial, economic,
social and environmental due
diligence and scrutiny?
This brings me to one closer
to my doorstep. A few years
back, the Quinjan Group,
operating as CNQC, hired space
in a residential area on Ngong
Road, ostensibly as a depot for
its fleet of road construction


〇〇〇





trucks. It applied for a Nema
camp-site licence, which
was granted. But it has since
transformed itself into a fully
fledged industry producing bulk
aggregate for road construction,
complete with the associated
noise and air pollution in a
zoned residential area with
domestic dwellings on one side
and farmland on the other.
This is done under the
auspices and jurisdiction of the
Kenya Urban Roads Authority
(Kura), under the Ministry
of Transport, Infrastructure,
Housing and Urban
Development. How it acquired
the paperwork to do this is an
open question and why Kura
has not reined in the rogue
operator an even bigger query. It
certainly can’t plead ignorance.
This is now subject to a court
case instigated by Nema. See
the ironic and exceedingly
embarrassing situation of a
government authority, under the
Department of Environment,
Nema, in conflict with another,
Kura, under the Transport one.
Much of what has been
described above would not have
taken place had both processes
been conducted in a transparent
and professional manner.

ince Covid-19 erupted, the
world has put its trust in
〇〇〇

virologists, epidemiologists,
modellers and disease experts
have stolen the show, rendering
fields such as social sciences
dispensable, if not useless, as
often declared.
On countless occasions,
we have been told that the
coronavirus is first a health
issue, and that’s why health
experts have been deployed with
abandon. Regardless, we must
remain alert to the aftermath of
the pandemic. Top on the list
will be a battered economy.
Whereas Covid-19 caught us
unawares, the same shall not be
said of its effects. And this is
where experts in humanities and
social sciences must showcase
their mettle. They must get set
to pick up the baton from health
scientists once the storm calms.
Of note are economists.
They must assess the situation
rationally and realistically,
devoid of the usual idealism.
Social distancing has reduced
production and consumption
of goods and services. The
governments’ main source of



funding, taxes, is curtailed.
Various options have
been floated, including
debt restructuring and
more borrowing. But these
are dependent on foreign
economies, which are equally
battered. We must plan with
that in mind, conscious of a dip
in the diaspora remittances.
Most of the solutions will,
therefore, be sought within.
That brings me to our
response to challenges.
Recently, the National Research



**DEGREE VERSUS EXPERIENCE.** The recent exchange
between Senators James Orengo and Kipchumba Murkomen
over Prof Kithure Kindiki’s ouster as Senate Deputy Speaker,
Raphael Obonyo notes, “was ugly, embarrassing and
shameful”. Raphael adds: “Orengo, a senior counsel, flaunted
his experience and Murkomen his academic achievements.
It was embarrassing to watch both get personal. I strongly
believe that you cannot dismiss someone simply because they
lack experience. But success is also not solely determined by
academic qualifications. If that were the case, there would be no
Steve Jobs or Mark Zuckerberg. They should jointly apologise to
the youth.” His contact is raphojuma@hotmail.com.


**WEIGHT OF PAPERS.** For Stephen Masambu, the
Orengo-Kipchumba altercation raises the question:
What’s in a degree? Says Stephen: “That Senator
Orengo is an accomplished debater and decorated
lawyer is not in doubt. But for Murkomen to charge
that Orengo is ‘only’ a lower second class degree
holder while he got an upper second class and
has two master’s degrees is a fallacy.” Murkomen
should do the weighting of his qualifications against
time. An undergraduate degree of whatever kind in
the 1970s is easily equal to his two master’s”. His
contact is masambus@yahoo.com.


**MASTER OF BLACKOUTS.** Urgently calling Kenya Power is
Kisumu resident Charles Okore, alarmed that neighbouring
customers who share Sinyolo Girls High School’s electricity
transformer have suffered a blackout for nearly a week. He
poses: “Whom do we turn to for help when the Kenya Power
MD’s office could not keep a promise they made to me four
days ago, that electricity would be restored the same day?”
Even more annoying to Charles was the Kisumu customer
service office’s response to his inquiry: “ _Hiyo transformer yenu_
_imelipuka. Tukipata ingine tutaleta!_ (Your transformer has
blown up. If we get one, we will bring it over.” His account is
31149494 and his contact charlesokore2@gmail.com.


**DESPERATION.** Following the massive layoffs due
to the Covid-19 pandemic, some people in the lower
Tana River region have taken to charcoal burning as a
source of income, says F. Mukembu. This, he warns, is
bound to lead to widespread deforestation if allowed
to go on. “The chiefs are, however, doing all they can
to stamp out the vice, especially now that these areas
are being ravaged by floods. The government should
give relief food to the flood victims to save our forests
as the charcoal burning is out of frustration.” He says
the floods have claimed several lives in the area. His
contact is fmukembu@gmail.com.

**NEGLECTED ROAD.** One of the most remarkable
developments in recent years has been the construction
of elaborate bypasses and highways across the country.
However, feeling left out are the people of Mukululu Village
in Igembe Central Constituency, Meru County, says Fredrick
Kiyuki. The residents, he adds, strongly believe their elected
leaders have abandoned them as they are yet to benefit from
the development goodies being generously dished out by the
national and county governments. “Our road from Nturuba
to Kiegoi has been in a poor state and almost impassable
for years. No wonder it becomes a campaign issue year after
year!” His contact is fredrickkiyuki@gmail.com.


**YOUTH JOBS.** The appointment of retired Supreme
Court Judge Prof Jackton Ojwang to chair the
Energy and Regulatory Authority (EPRA) board at
the age of 70 has not gone down well with Samuel
Onyango. He is also unhappy with the choice of Prof
Mabel Imbuga to chair Nacada. This, he moans, is
a slap in the face of jobless youth. “When are we
going to get these plum positions? Why hire people
who should be enjoying their retirement? We have
very many qualified youth who would cherish an
opportunity to work for their government and serve
the nation.” His contact is samwel46@gmail.com.

Fund (NRF) sent out a call for
health science researchers for
Covid-19 investigations.
I saw this as duplicity.
Granted, many inquiries —
and at high levels — are under
way. Thousands of related
reports are freely floating on
_Elsevier,_ _Nature_ online journals
and elsewhere. We can build on
them to save time and money.
I expected NRF to equally
send a call to social scientists
inviting inquiries on how the
economy should be resuscitated.
Or are they waiting for
politicians to provide direction?


**Caught in cyclic web**
We must inquire on how we’ll
recover the uncollected taxes.
One way is through limiting
expenditure, which can be
achieved if corruption is purged.
Another way is through
scaling down mega projects. Of
course they spur the economy;
unfortunately, they are major
conduits of corruption. Hence,
we are caught in a cyclic web
which requires critical thinking.
We should ask why some
interventions failed or could
not be adopted. For instance,



the much-hyped total lockdown
wouldn’t work in Kenya.
Social scientists should,
therefore, be tasked to propose
job creation avenues, jobs
that equally solve some of the
problems that we have long
experienced, like food security.
As we prepare for low donor
funding, higher poverty levels,
demand-pull inflation, higher
taxation, among other nasty
eventualities, we must enlist all
relevant professionals to provide
direction. Crime rates are likely
to soar, and so are social and
psychological problems.
Therefore, experts such as
educationists, economists,
counsellors, theologians,
philosophers, historians,
sociologists and jurists ought
to be part of the post-pandemic
war chest. Mathew Flinders,
a professor of politics at
the University of Sheffield,
said Covid-19 revealed the
weaknesses of thinking in
mono-disciplinary terms
All professions matter.

Punish these commuters
who disobey ferry rules


For some time now, the Kenya
Ferry Services has audited its safety
standards to enhance commuter
safety. It has also deployed modern methods to avert unnecessary
injuries. Managing director Bakari
Gowa has made customer safety a
key priority, at a par with safe passage across Likoni and Mtongwe
channels. But these good gestures
have not been reciprocated. Lorries
and cars continue crashing into the
ramp, causing long delays. Some
passengers, also, force themselves
into the ferries while in motion.
These should all be punished.

New Cabinet posts will
just drain public money
The creation of extra Cabinet
positions, dubbed Chief Administrative Secretaries (CAS), will be a
drain to the national coffers. It is
regrettable that President Uhuru
Kenya and the Jubilee government
promised all sorts of election losers
jobs and he now feels compelled
to keep his word. But the voting
wananchi feel cheated. Their hardearned cash, paid as taxes and
other levies, will go down the drawn
in the form of exorbitant salaries
for a small elite who have neither
the energy nor the inclination to
perform their duties.

New laws have made
student politics better
In an opinion piece published by
the _Sunday Nation_ (21/01/2018),
Dr Tom Odhiambo misconstrued
the Universities (Amendment) Act,
2016, saying “student politics will be
controlled by the State” and thereby
“Kenyans will lose”. Laws are made
to cure mischief. Being a recent
graduate, I can confirm that student
politics had sunk to a shameful low. I
once contested for a position at Moi
University and it was gruesome, with
ethnic divisions and violence. The
new Act remedies these anomalies.

Be wary of matatu thieves


Last Saturday, I was a victim of
new pickpocket mode. At the Utawala Benedicta stage, Nairobi, two
people boarded the matatu I was in.
Then the tout shouted that the front
door was faulty, and the person
next to me said he had heard something fall. The matatu stopped. By
then the woman ahead of me, and
myself, had lost our phones.

he government’s recent
emphasis on promot## T ing the manufacturing

sector as a way of creating
new job opportunities is
good, but if not anchored on
strong policy, it might not
yield the desired results.
During the Jubilee government’s first term in
office, great focus was put
on infrastructure development, which must be
applauded. The government
has now identified four pillars that will guide its second
term agenda. Kenyans will
be keen to see how the two
levels of government will leverage on these projects.
In manufacturing, the
government has set its
eyes on four labour intensive areas — blue economy,
agro-processing, leather and
textile industries. If meaningful gain is to be achieved,
there must be strong collaborations between the central
and county governments.
To start with, the
amount allocated to county
governments should be commensurate to the role they
will be expected to play. And
county governments must
prioritise job creation.

PERENNIAL SNARL-UP: A regular commuter on Mombasa

at Cabanas Restaurant. “They block traffic on the highway for
even up to 10 minutes, and yet there is traffic from Syokimau,
Mlolongo, Athi River, Utawala and Kitengela. The vehicles from
Embakasi flow freely, as the newly rebuilt Outering Road is now

goodwill between the two
levels of government will
be. The close to 500km line
passes through Mombasa,
Taita Taveta, Kilifi, Kwale,
Makueni, Machakos and Nairobi counties.
These county governments
must create economic road
maps to gain from the colossal project. Already, special
economic zones are in the
pipeline. Creation of jobs for
the youth has preoccupied
successive governments.
But there have been inconsistencies and lack of clear
strategies. Although the Jubilee government promised
to create 1.3 million jobs
annually, the level of youth
unemployment is still high,
at about 63 per cent.
With expansion of infrastructure projects to rural
areas, ways should be devised to make all counties
economic hubs. This will arrest rural-urban migration.



Many empowerment programmes have been created.
They include Youth Enterprise Development Fund,
Uwezo Fund and the 30 per
cent access to government
procurement opportunities.
These projects have failed to
meet the envisaged results
and should be revised.
We should also create a
culture of entrepreneurship
among the youth, by giving
them skills and training. This
should be supported by access to capital and markets.
The Constitution in Article
55 is clear that the State has
an obligation to ensure access to relevant education,
training and employment.
Also, Parliament must
enact laws that guide the
country in creating more
opportunities for the youth.
The recently passed National Youth Employment Act
(2016), largely meant to address youth unemployment,
has not been implemented.
Instead, the government
plans to create a Youth Development Council.
Youthful leaders have their
work cut out. They must
work with youth serving
groups to ensure that unemployment is minimised.

The Kenya Film Classification Board has
exhibited great zeal in enhancing industry
compliance with the set rules and laws.
The board, under Dr Ezekial Mutua, has
stopped at nothing to ensure that musicians,
film makers, industry players and regulators
conform to regulations spelt out by the KFCB
Act.
The board has traversed Kenya to sensitise
citizens and netizens on the need for compliance and their rights and obligations as spelt
out in Cap 222.
Dr Mutua has variously elaborated on the
dangers of irresponsible film industry practices and spelt out rewards and punishment
for those who comply or defy.
These measures have helped nip in the bud
the airing of scandalous programmes during
school holidays, to the relief of many parents.



However, a recent disclosure by KFCB
on gambling in Kilifi and coastal counties is
shocking.
Dr Mutua said that minors aged below 13
were actively involved in gambling and were
being lured into immoral activities to raise
cash for gaming.
Tellingly, Dr Mutua blamed gambling for
declining education standards in the region.
Education and good morals go hand in hand.
They cannot be deferred, shelved, ignored or
wished away.
This problem resonates across the width
and breadth of Kenya. All county governments should join hands with KFCB to
eradicate vices that threaten the future of
the youth. A responsible youth is a boon to
strong nationhood and prosperity.

The move by the Salaries and
Remuneration Commission to
scrap 140 allowances paid to civil
servants is welcome. This may
help to reduce the heavy financial
burden on ‘Wanjiku’ of spending 53
per cent of taxes on public service
salaries. But low-income earners
might face more financial woes.
Most Kenyans are struggling to
meet their basic needs with meagre
incomes. The scraping ought to
target highly paid civil servants.

“Why we are buying diesel train
cars for city” ( _SN_, March 17),
does not only ring hollow but is
also hopelessly unconvincing.
A reader fails to grasp the
motive of the corporation, which
has been on the receiving end for
purchasing old, obsolete dieselpowered train cars when the
world is moving to electric, lesspolluting modes of transport. KR
exposes itself as an institution
that has been overtaken by events
and is living in the past.
At a time when the discourse
on climate change and transition
to low-emission development
trajectory is shaping international
diplomatic, political, economic
and social interactions in a
manner never witnessed before,
Mr Ndegwa looks completely
detached from reality.
Worryingly, KR is among the
many parastatals yet to embrace
the inevitable shift to the
future in the context of climate
change, which has necessitated
formulation of several policies
anchored on legislation
earmarked to address global
warming, signed by President
Uhuru Kenyatta in 2016.
This law requires citizens
and government institutions to
take action on climate change.
Part of that effort, mitigation,
is to take action that minimises
the greenhouse gases produced
by fossil fuel-based sources of
energy like diesel. Sectors such
as energy, agriculture, forestry,
transport and agriculture, our
economic mainstay, are adversely
affected and also contribute to





global warming.
As we build resilience of these
sectors, we need to honour our
commitment to international law,
particularly the Paris Agreement,
which was ratified by Parliament,
that requires Kenya to reduce
its emissions by 30 per cent by
2030 and targets the agriculture,
forestry and transport sectors.
Transport is an important
sector in Kenya’s ambition
to meet its obligation to
reduce dependence on fossil
energy, particularly petroleum.
Progressive countries, especially
in the West, are rapidly shifting to
cleaner, more efficient renewable
energy to power transport and
other drivers of economic growth.
The climate-change-conscious
Western citizens have invested
heavily in renewable technology
with more shifting to renewables,
rendering diesel-driven
locomotives obsolete.



For the past decade or
so, Western countries have
modernised their transport
systems to include “smart” trains
and cars. aced with the dilemma
on where to dump the old,
outdated locomotives, they either
donate them to Third World
countries as aid or, worse, longterm investments or loans.
This could explain why KR is
purchasing 25-year-old diesel
locomotives from Spain.
Just as with the standard gauge
railway (SGR), for which the
government purchased a dieselpowered system from China, the
locomotives which KR wants to
buy will not only pollute the city
but also quickly fall into disuse.
Why can’t KR start on a clean
slate with an electric system as in
Ethiopia and Tanzania?

**SATURDAY’S QUESTION**

〇〇〇



**RUTH GITUMA:** It’s saddening
that we continue to lose lives
in accidents involving these
trucks on our roads. We need to

borrow from international best
practices on how to avoid such
accidents.

**FRANCIS NJUGUNA:** This
problem is still with us and the



battle on the issue is not yet
over as more and more people
continue to be victims of road
accidents. Interestingly enough,
accidents involving head-on
collisions are seemingly on the
rise on Kenyan roads.

**FRANKLIN MUKEMBU:** I think

the accident was a result of



carelessness. Drivers ought to
take the initiative of personal
discipline to reduce such
incidents of road carnage.

**GEORGE MULINGE:** It’s high
time we gave big trucks and
transits their own special lanes
on the highways.



**BENJAMIN KOBARE:** The
government should ban trailers
from our highways, revamp the
meter gauge railway line and oil
pipeline and have heavy cargo
transported only by rail.

**ANN GAKII:** Drivers, especially
those of heavy trucks, should
not speed downhill. Most of



them disengage the gear and
tumble down the hill on “free”.
Such drivers, if caught, should
be jailed.

**ALICE ATIENO:** The government
should expand the roads where
there is a slope so that trucks
use the “climbing lane” even
when going downhill.


〇〇〇

**EMAILS FROM CORRESPONDENTS**


**FAMINE:** Article 43 of the Constitution gives
Kenyans the right to be “free from hunger and
have adequate food of acceptable quality”.
Officials should stop denying that Kenyans are
starving to death and come up with strategies
to educate communities on how to diversify
their diet and reduce dependence on maize. The
governors should invest in irrigation to increase
food production and reduce reliance on rain-fed
agriculture. A team should be set up to conduct
intensive research to develop region-specific
crops that are also disease- and pest-resistant.


**KAUNDA MAXWELL, Nairobi.**


**DOCTORS’ STRIKE:** The decision
by doctors in Kisumu County to go
on strike is inhuman as it will hurt
helpless patients. The nurses’ strike
in February to force implementation
of their 2017 CBA was in vain, the
resulting deaths and suffering of patients
notwithstanding. Counties should avert
the doctors’ strike by resolving their
grievances mutually. Human life being
is precious, the health sector is a critical
field that should not be interfered with.


**MIKE OKEYO, Migori**


**SEASON OF FAKES:** Of late, several cases
of fake currency, gold and medicines have
been reported in the mainstream media. The
architects of the counterfeits have gone a notch
higher and even have the audacity to circulate
newspapers with fake headlines! This criminal
web should be reined in as matter of national
interest. These are no ordinary law breakers;
they are agents of the underworld and should
never be entertained in a progressive society.
The justice system should ensure these criminals
are arrested, prosecuted and sent to prison.


**JAPHET TONUI K.K., Kericho**


**VETTING:** The vetting of nominees to
public positions must be taken seriously
and never politicised. Legislators should
weigh the situation and approve the
candidate who will benefit the whole
nation rather than a few individuals or
groups. The situation where a nominee is
passed by MPs or MCAs only to later be
declared unfit to hold office is a shame.
It clearly shows that such matters need
to be taken seriously and given more
attention by the lawmakers.


**ABIGAEL JADAH, Kisumu**


**WOMEN’S SAFETY:** In Kenya, 2,600 women
die every year from complications related to
unsafe abortion. This accounts for up to 11 per
cent of deaths globally. Lack of awareness is
among the causes of unsafe abortion. Treating
abortion-related cases is expensive, making
women and girls to opt for unsafe abortion.
Women at risk of unsafe abortions need support
and not censorship. Communities should focus
on education on sexual and reproductive health
and rights, whereby one has freedom to decide
whether or not to have children.

Punish teachers who
prey on their pupils


A teacher is regarded as a
second parent to a child. But some
of them are tarnishing the good
reputation. With every dawning
day, there is always an incident of a
teacher assaulting students either
physically or sexually. Despite the
immorality demon that is imminent
in our today's world, our teachers
are the last people we expect to
fall into that pit. We certainly need
the _mwalimu_ we once knew and
respected.

questions. Let the Senate continue

voted for you, not the MPs.

_With these bloopers, who will_

( _Sunday Nation_, July 22) to go
unchallenged would be rather
careless.
What criteria could the reporter
have used to conclude that the
government statement on the
standard gauge railway was a plea
to bear with the Chinese?
For the benefit of
student journalists, media
pronouncements by civil servants
do not derive their value from
momentary public applause or
euphoria: Their intrinsic worth
lies in their capacity to draw
public attention to the objective
reality of the matters under
reference.
It, therefore, came to pass
that, at a time when everybody
was frothing in the mouth and
steaming in the ears on alleged
Chinese racism, the Government
Spokesman went beyond the
outrage and pointed towards our
national work ethic.
Without pre-empting the
investigations, the lingering
message was that nations have
not developed because racism
was eliminated; they achieved
high standards of living for their
citizens because of national work
ethics that sustained long-term
value addition. Kaizen is just one
of these.

racial discrimination. On the
last, the frame of reference was
manifested as the Constitution
with a firm assurance that the
State will protect citizens’ human
rights and fundamental freedoms.
Of necessity, the statement
had to go deeper. Strategic
accountabilities for those
privileged to pioneer the SGR
legacy had to come into play.
Particular focus was placed
on the integrity of employees
to internal human capital
management policies, procedures
and regulations.
It was unequivocally stated that
rules and regulations are made to
be followed. Indeed, consistent
adherence to policies, procedures
and regulations is a fundamental
qualification for employees
wishing to continue serving any



organisation, whether public or
private. We, therefore, took issue
with employees who preferred
extra-institutional channels
to air grievances. We asserted
that the words “espionage”
and “sabotage” still retain their
meaning in the English language.
Moreover, those trusted with the
responsibility of taking over SGR
operations in less than four years
must look beyond dining rooms,
toilets and staff cars.
I hope the _ad hominem_ vitriol
by Kipchumba was not intended
to annul our reference to a
national work ethic. A country
where surgeons open the wrong
heads and public procurement
regulations are contemptuously
overlooked, must treat workplace
ethics as an emergency.

**EMAILS FROM CORRESPONDENTS**


**LIFESTYLE AUDIT:** The only way the
government can recover a huge chunk
of the ill-acquired wealth by stickyfingered civil servants is by conducting a
meticulous lifestyle audit on all of them.
Some of the civil servants cannot explain
the source of their wealth — for instance,
how can a civil servant with a Sh100,000
salary and has worked for less than
15 years having a net worth of Sh600
million? Even if he saved the entire
salary, he would have Sh180 million.
**VICK OKUMU, Kisumu.**


**TEACHERS’ STRIKE:** It is insincere for
Knut secretary-general Wilson Sossion
to call a teachers’ strike because of
delocalisation and appraisal of tutors.
There are other pressing issues —
such as medical cover by AoN and
salaries for common cadres of teachers
— that he should pursue. Teachers
were demorolised when the CBA only
benefited the administrators. TCS has
also insisted that delocalisation is part of
agreement they signed with unions.
**NATHAN MUTHAMIA, Tharaka-Nithi.**


**COFFEE FARMING:** I read Dr Patrick
Mbataru's article on agriculture ( _DN_, July
25) and would like to provide him with a
different perspective of what's possible
with the coffee sector. Instead of moving
on to more profitable agricultural
opportunities such as dairy, avocado and
macadamia, why not simply introduce
greater innovation in the coffee subsector? Don't write off the innovation
that coffee farmers can bring to bear in
the sector with government support.
**MICHAEL WARUI, via email.**


**CHILDLESSNESS:** In many
communities, childlessness in a marriage
is usually blamed on the woman. The
man will be advised to remarry — as
many times as he wants — if the woman
is not fertile. Men never see themselves
as a cause of childlessness and can
never go for a test to know the cause of
the problem. And it is hard for them to
come to terms with that. Men should
understand that women are human and
couples accept each other as they are.

_up to US$40 trillion to support infrastructure de-_
_velopment in the global south. Suddenly, govern-_
_ments are investing in new roads, railways, pipe-_
_lines, power lines and other infrastructure pro-_
_jects._
_The government has responded to this by pro-_
_posing the Lamu Port South Sudan and Ethiopia_
_Transport corridor or developed the Standard_
_Gauge Railway (SGR) project to support develop-_
_ment. The SGR has been subjected to a compre-_
_hensive environmental impact assessment (EIA)_
_to minimise social and ecological impacts. How-_
_ever, these assessments have been criticised for_
_being superficial._
_The EIA is an essential environmental and so-_
_cial safeguard. It’s a decision-making tool that sys-_
_tematically evaluates the possible significant im-_
_pacts that a proposed project may exert on the_
_environment. The result of which should guide_
_action to protect humans, any threatened wild-_
_life species and their habitats and any other re-_
_sources by halting the project, redesigning it, or_
_mitigate the impacts. As much as this is the expec-_
_tation, or at least should be the norm, projects are_
_rarely stopped on the recommendations of the_
_EIAs or mitigation measures properly carried out._
_There are numerous examples of projects that_
_have been allowed to proceed vide an EIA recom-_
_mendation regardless of the evidence of their en-_
_vironmental and social impacts._
_In 2012, the first phase of the SGR through Tsa-_
_vo West and East national parks was given the_
_thumbs-up. Fast forward to 2016, another EIA_
_gave the green light to the second phase of the_
_SGR through the Nairobi National Park, Ngong_
_Forest and the fragile areas of Suswa in Narok and_
_Kajiado counties. Potential environmental and_
_social impacts identified were assessed as man-_
_ageable through the recommendations of the_
_EIA reports. However, researchers at the Devel-_
_opment Corridors Partnership have established_
_that the railway and associated infrastructure_
_have resulted in habitat fragmentation, blocking_
_migratory routes for elephants, loss of threatened_
_wildlife species through road-kills and emer-_
_gence of invasive plant species. Furthermore, the_









_construction of the railway has also disturbed_
_natural water flows causing unexpected flood-_
_ing, water pollution and channeling of surface_
_runoffs. This leads to gulley erosions and down-_
_stream flooding, affecting small-scale farmers,_
_pastoralists and wildlife whose livelihoods and_
_survival depend on these resources. Eventually, it_
_creates human-wildlife conflicts._


**What is the problem with the EIAs?**
_In theory, there is no problem with EIA but there_
_is a deficient implementation and, in some cases,_
_a chronic lack of institutional capacity and politi-_
_cal goodwill to carry it out properly. The key issue_
_is that positive and negative impacts on nature_
_and people from the proposed developments are_
_not being appropriately assessed. One key issue is_
_the lack of meaningful public consultation to al-_
_low local communities to hear and understand_
_what is proposed and what the implications for_
_their lives might be but more importantly, that_
_they feel they have a choice. The second key issue_
_is that the whole suite of potential impacts on na-_
_ture is not considered. On one hand, Kenya has_
_rich wildlife, 65-70 per cent of which thrives out_
_of protected areas, which is part of the nation’s_
_identity and a source of the livelihoods of many_
_people. Second, the benefits that nature provides_
_to people are compromised with bad planning._
_Both can be impacted by infrastructure develop-_
_ment in negative ways._


**So, what are the solutions?**
_The fact that a country has an EIA process in_
_place does not mean it will work. First, there_



_needs to be appropriate resources in place to al-_
_low comprehensive and meaningful impact as-_
_sessment. This includes developing the capaci-_
_ty of companies to write good terms of reference_
_(TOR) which are the contracts where the impact_
_assessment work is agreed upon, train consult-_
_ants to be able to carry out such assessment and_
_have access to appropriate biodiversity data and_
_tools to understand the impacts and design the_
_solutions. At an institutional level, those who re-_
_view and give (or do not) green light to the pro-_
_posed developments need to be sufficiently re-_
_sourced and well trained to do a good job._
_More importantly, banks financing these me-_
_ga-projects need to follow best practices in impact_
_mitigation and not to provide money for projects_
_that are likely to be socially and ecologically un-_
_sustainable. We have the standards and frame-_
_works to ensure sustainability, but we need to get_
_the process right. One example of a good practice_
_framework is the so-called mitigation hierarchy. It_
_proposes a very simple four-step process when a_
_project is being planned for._
_First, avoid any important impacts that your_
_project may cause (re-design, re-evaluate); sec-_
_ond, when the risk to cause some important im-_
_pacts still remain, develop plans to mitigate them_
_(well-designed wildlife crosses); third, restore_
_what has been degraded; and finally, compensate_
_for any impacts that remain. These four steps, if_
_well designed and managed, can deliver positive_
_results. But this cannot happen if there are no re-_
_sources and appropriate capacity._
_Finally, the transnational and often trans-re-_
_gional nature of these projects needs a strategic_
_approach. Kenya and at least 40 other countries_
_have regulations in place to run impact assess-_
_ment that goes beyond a single project. They take_
_a more strategic approach, looking at the govern-_
_ment’s plans, programmes and policies. These are_
_strategic impact assessments. Their purpose is_

〇〇〇

_vital lessons from the milestones they have so far made._
_The country recently elevated the first female to the_

_woman serving as the Auditor General, Nancy Gathun-_

_et, Charity Ngilu of Kitui and Kirinyaga’s Ann Waiguru._
_We also have 23.3 per cent of parliamentarians as_
_women, which has been an improvement every elec-_
_tion. The Constitution created women representatives’_
_seats in the National Assembly. Women have been ap-_
_pointed to the Cabinet, parastatal and departmental_
_heads, heads of private sector boards and professional_
_associations among many other areas in the society._
_From1952, when Maendeleo Ya Wanawake Movement_

**Development index**
_We have entrenched gender issues in legislation, pol-_

ago, Julius Caesar,

liked to wear robes made
of Chinese silk. The silk
products were transported
through a trade route linking
Asia and Europe that would
be known as the Silk Road.
More than 600 years ago,
a fl eet led by the Chinese
navigator Zheng He arrived
at Mombasa and Malindi,
bringing porcelain, silk and
tea. The king of Malindi sent
his envoy along on a return
visit with a giraff e as a gift.
That had opened the
“Maritime Silk Road”.
Five years ago, while
visiting some Asian
countries, including
Indonesia and Kazakhstan,
Chinese President Xi Jinping
proposed the Silk Road
Economic Belt and the 21stCentury Maritime Silk Road
(the Belt and Road).
The Belt and Road
Initiative (BRI) acts in

MPs should rethink the slashing of the
National Youth Service (NYS) budget.
The NYS is simply a government-sponsored youth ‘militia’, an organised ‘gang’
formed on the same premise as Mungiki.
Mungiki’s agenda was to fi ll the vacuum created by the then-Nyayo regime
in the Mt Kenya region. Coff ee and tea
sectors had been sabotaged, causing
mass unemployment, which led to
insecurity.
Some local leaders organised young
men into saccos that eventually took over
the matatu industry. In towns, they even
rehabilitated criminals and street boys
into garbage collection groups.
In places like Banana in Kiambu and
Muthithi, Murang’a, where walking at
night was very unsafe, Mungiki gave
escort. The young men became so busy
that women would often nudge their sons
to join Mungiki. But politics infi ltrated
the noble idea, causing leadership wrangles and creating factions, and extortion
began. It would soon be outlawed. NYS
was formed along those lines.
Parliament’s decision to starve the
NYS of funds was an act of strangulation.
In the name of ending corruption at the
NYS, let us not create a fi eld for criminal
gangs and terrorist groups to recruit jobless youth. Having NYS cadres suddenly
left jobless would be a national security
disaster — what with the outfi t being a
paramilitary organisation. Prevent graft
but do not kill the NYS.

Belt and Road, creating a

The initiative has since
transformed itself from
a vision to reality. China
has signed 103 agreements
with 88 countries and
international organisations.
It worked with 43 countries
and set up 75 overseas
economic and trade
cooperation zones, paying
$2.2 billion taxes to the
hosts and creating 200,000
jobs.
Trade and investment
have been growing rapidly
with the trading volume
surpassing $4 trillion and
investment at $60 billion.
The BRI is a refl ection
of common aspirations for
prosperity and development
and meets the need to tackle
challenges.


**Double standard**
However, some people are
too critical to be objective.
They label it as “not abiding
by the rules” when it does
not accord with their double
standards. They deem it
as “discrimination and
prejudice” even if there is
just some misunderstanding.
They claim that there is a
“debt trap” when they just
see the word “loan”. They



worry about it themselves.
Not a few countries
in Asia and Africa are,
indeed, worrying due to
the situations of poverty,
unemployment, ethnic
confl icts and refugee crisis.
If I may ask the critics
and doubting Thomases:
What could you bring to
these countries? The answer
seems like, as an Asian
economist puts it, “NATO”
(No Action, Talk Only)!
No country has been
crippled by a debt crisis



The SGR has driven up
Kenya’s economic growth
by 1.5 per cent and created
46,000 jobs. Since its launch
on May 31, last year, the
passenger volume for the

hit 1.58 million and freight
trains hauled 112,000

The goal of this project
is to enable Kenyans to be

umias Sugar Company has been
a playground of brokers and
〇〇〇

time before it was put under receivership
by someone it owed money.
Had the government not been pumping billions of shillings into this sickly
monolith, chances are that it would have
collapsed several years back. Now, its
assets are up for grabs and Mumias has
a painful legacy.
Mumias used to make profits by the
grace of God -- because it was a poorly
crafted project. In 1996, its financialls
indicated that it made a net profit of
Sh6.3 billion. Then two years down
later, things had gone so wrong that the
company was issuing bouncing cheques
to farmers and suppliers.
But trouble had started earlier when
a modernisation project that was expected to improve this factory’s milling
capacity — and championed by its then
chairman, the late George Saitoti — became a conduit to fleece the company.
Parliament was told that Prof Saitoti had
awarded an exclusive contract to British
firm Fletcher and Smith to supply spare
parts to the company. The local agent for
this company was Joseph Schwartzman’s
H.Young, an Israeli engineering firm that
counted on the then powerful Cabinet
minister Nicholas Biwott to win lucrative tenders. Its other local director was
Schwartzman’s wife Hannah.
“That is when theft started at the
company,” said Wycliffe Osundwa, then
Mumias MP.
But the matter was much deeper than
that. H. Young had, in the early 1990s,
won the $33 million (Sh3.4 billion in
current cunversion rate) Mumias Rationalisation Project deal to install a
7,500 tonnes of cane per day diffuser. It
was a joint venture with Fletcher Smith
Ltd UK, and South Africa’s sugar giant
Tongatt Hulett.
But that is the tail-end of the story.
What Mumias farmers had never been
told was that the entire factory -- plus
the later expansions in 1990 -- was
designed by Fletcher and Stewart, and
that the firm had patented the designs,
which meant that the spare parts would
exclusively be purchased from it, the
price notwithstanding.
How did we get here?
Two years after independence, the
Jomo Kenyatta government had decided
to find a cash crop for western Kenya
and asked British company Bookers
Agricultural and Technical Services Ltd
to undertake a pilot scheme to establish
the viability of a sugar project. When
you look back, this was a scandal-ridden
undertaking.
This was largely a political undertaking
and, by 1970, a final feasibility report was
released after five years of study.
Mumias Sugar Company was set up
in June 1971 with the government holding a majority share (69 per cent). The
other shareholders were Commonwealth
Development Corporation (12 per cent),
Kenya Commercial Finance (9 per cent),
East African Development Bank (5 per
cent) and Booker McConnell (5 per cent).
What Kenyans were never told was



that the company that did the feasibility
study was a subsidiary of the company
that designed the factory (Fletcher and
Stewart) and also a subsidiary of Booker
McConnell, the company that was later to
get the management contract. In essence,
the company that was asked to undertake
a study on the viability of Mumias had
an interest in getting other tenders. That
is how Mumias was mooted, and we can
thank the British Government’s Overseas
Development Corporation and others for
financing that mischief.
The first problem encountered by the
government was how to grow cane in
smallholdings of 10 acres and whether
to organise the new cane farmers into
co-operatives. The coffee farmers in
Central Kenya had been organised into
co-operatives, an experiment that was
still being watched by the ministries of
agriculture and co-operatives.
After the failure of co-operatives in
Chemelil Sugar, the first experiment on
smallholder sugar production in Kenya,
a war of words started in 1971 between
Cabinet ministers Jeremiah Nyaga of
Agriculture and Masinde Muliro of
Co-operatives over how to organise the
cane farmers. The ensuing blame-game
informed the future of cane farming in
the country.
On February 1, 1972, at Rhodes House
in Nairobi’s Kenyatta Avenue, a draft was
placed before the under-secretaries of the
treasury, agriculture and co-operatives
ministries and that is what became the
blueprint for the sugar industry. The
meeting approved the formation of Mumias Outgrowers Organisation Limited,
whose aim was create a buffer between the
farmers and Mumias Sugar Company. In a
letter to the Ministry of Agriculture, Bookers’ project manager M.N. Lucie-Smith
lamented that the freehold landowners
needed “a great deal of indoctrination”
to accept co-operatives.
The Treasury, then under Mwai Kibaki,
started pushing for an outgrowers’ organisation, rather than a co-operative.
But the people who were to implement
the project were busy fighting. In a protest letter he wrote to the Permanent
Secretary for Agriculture Joe Kibe, the
Commissioner of Co-operatives, a Mr
Muthama, dismissed the outgrowers
organisation as nothing new.
“In our view, this type of organisation
is not a new innovation (sic), as it has
been tried in Muhoroni Sugar Settlement without success… the proposed



outgrower organisation will be viewed by
the local people to be investors or at best
government tool rather than outgrowers
representative… I doubt if those people
who propose it intend it to be (an outgrowers’ representative).”
Another co-operatives technocrat,
J. Laban Murungi, then an assistant
commissioner, wrote to Mr Muthama
cautioning against pushing for an outgrowers organisation “which will never
work” and suggesting that the funds be
used to set up a strong co-operative.
Amid the chaos, Mumias was founded
even as Mr Muthama on March 23, 1973
dismissed the outgrowers’ proposal as
an “ineffective and expensive temporary
palliative.”
He might have been right.
Eight months before, in July 1972, it
had been agreed by technocrats that Mumias Outgrowers Company (Moco) would
be formed owned by the government,
outgrowers and Mumias Sugar Company
Limited. Later in 1975, Moco was formed
and took over the responsibility of providing credit to all contracted outgrowers
-- to represent the interests of the outgrowers with Mumias Sugar Company,
the government and other outside bodies,
and to negotiate on behalf of farmers.
But soon it went rogue and would make
fraudulent deductions from farmers’
earnings by overcharging services such
as land preparation, survey, provision of
seeds, fertiliser, harvesting and transport.
The government would also second the
local district commissioner as an official
of the outgrowers company – and at some
point, the chairman.
This happened under the watchful eyes
of Booker, the management firm, to an
extent that Kimilili MP Mukhisa Kituyi
in 1998 accused Booker Tate of “running
down Mumias Sugar Company, so that
they can buy a shell company.""
""Ms Booker Tate have an interest in
destroying Mumias Sugar so that they
buy it at a throwaway price. How can
the government continue being a slave
to an illegal authorisation (where) a
subsidiary company wholly owned by
Booker McConnell and Tate Lion has
been given an open contract to make
supplies to Mumias Sugar to the tune of
Sh750 million every year? We are bleeding
the farmers, bankrupting them,” he said.
The other problem was cane supply.
From the very beginning, and in order
to have a constant supply of cane, it was
decided that Mumias would need its own



nucleus estate of about 8,000 acres, and
the outgrowers would manage the balance
of 20,000 acres within a 12-kilometre
radius of the factory. Outside that, the
cane-growing would not be profitable,
thanks to huge transport costs. It was
left to the British firm to manage the
farmers – the way it did in Guyana.
The Overseas Development Institute
had by 1974 hailed Mumias as a “resounding success,” but the farmers had
a different story. Mumias Sugar had
thought that the programme of cultivation that mimicked a large plantation
would be followed by smallholder farmers.
They were wrong. and that is how the
challenge of mechanising cane farming
developed.
Mumias is by far the largest miller in
Kenya, with about 66,000 registered
outgrowers. But by the time it went under,
it was only doing less than 20 per cent of
its capacity due to a biting cane shortage.
How a company that was supposed to
produce about 50 per cent of the domestic
sugar output could book losses running
into billions of shillings is the sad tale of
mismanagement, wanton theft and policy
failure. If you want to know the story of
Mumias, look at the fortunes of its past
managers, directors and their associates
in both procurement and distribution.
On June 30, 2003, the Booker Tate
management contract with Mumias
ended and they advertised for the position
of a managing director. The recruitment
was done by PricewaterhouseCoopers.
They picked Evans Kidero as the new
boss. The less said about Dr Kidero and
Mumias, the better.
In 2008, the giant Mumias Outgrowers
Company collapsed, leaving the farmers
with no voice at the factory level.
What was foreseen as far back as 1971,
even before farmers were enticed to grow
cane, has come back to haunt the Mumias
cane growers.
Sugar consultant Mr B.J. Warnes had
warned that “without collective discipline, the cane supply will be sporadic:
Either too little, resulting in idle time at
the mill and therefore high production
costs, or too much (where) the mill will
not be able to handle it (leading to) cane
spoils, high costs and recurring losses.”
To deal with this problem, the expert
suggested that an organisation be formed
that can have “dictatorial” powers to enforce discipline on the more than 3,000
outgrowers, which he warned would be
a “highly sophisticated, technical and
political operation.”
KCB and its receiver managers might
not turn around this enterprise. The best
they can do is bring the lie to an end and
allow private entities to run the show.
Mumias has squandered a lot of our
money, and has a painful legacy.

green initiatives across the
country and prevent Kenya
from becoming a dumping
ground for substandard and
poisonous goods.
Strict enforcement of
quality would also ensure
local factories are not at
the mercy of counterfeits,
which are killing the source
of livelihood for millions of
people and reversing our
economic gains.
For consumers, the
National Treasury should
relook at levies and taxes
charged on housing
materials.


**Cap VAP**
The government should
lend a hand in supporting
these initiatives by reducing
the cost of doing business
by capping Value Added Tax
at 10 per cent for between
three and five years to give
consumers a reprieve while
enabling the construction
sector to flourish.
Another issue the
Exchequer should address
to spur growth of the
manufacturing sector,
particularly the paint
industry, is the VAT levied
on kerosene, which, in
the long run, impacts the
bottom-line of the sector.
Such bottlenecks need to be
addressed with priority.



hen President
Uhuru Kenyatta was
〇〇〇

for his second and final
term last year, he identified
manufacturing, affordable
housing, universal healthcare
and enhanced food
security as the four pillars
for catalysing economic
development over the next
five years.
Dubbed the ‘Big Four’
agenda, this plan is poised
to improve the livelihoods of
Kenyans.
Looking critically at it, it’s
clear that the manufacturing
sector and increasing
the stock of affordable
housing are twin efforts
that can lessen the acute job
shortage, especially amongst
the youth, if implemented in
the right way.
Under the affordable
housing pillar, which
targets construction of
500,000 units over the next
five years, there is a big
opportunity to create jobs,
both directly and indirectly,
while supporting the
manufacturing agenda.
On average, a house
creates at least 15 direct jobs
— from porters to painters,
plumbers and electricians.
Indirectly, there are more
jobs created for transporters,
loaders and distributors of

Africa totally depends on the
environment for its political and
socio-economic development.
According to data from the
CIA’s _World Factbook_, of the top 15
countries that largely depend on
agriculture, 13 are in Africa with
Liberia leading with the sector
contributing 76 per cent of GDP.
That means a large percentage
of Africans are destined for
poverty and annihilation if climate
change issues are not addressed.
The Framework for Action
(FfA), one of the two outcome
documents of the 2014 Second
International Conference on
Nutrition (ICN2), explicitly cites
climate change and dwindling
biodiversity as threats to
planetary health.
With no African country among
the top 10 food producers, it is
at greater risk of food security
if climate policy frameworks are
formulated with the interests of
the developed world in mind.
The African Union (AU) should
take a lead role in the policy
formulation. The next Conference
of Parties (CoP) even having an
African stamp on it.

housing materials.
Conservatively, if the
houses are put up at the rate
of 100,000 units per year,
this endeavour will create
1.5 million jobs and offer
employment to thousands of
students who graduate from
our technical and vocational
training institutes.
Additionally, to roll out
a housing project of this
magnitude will require
massive amounts of
construction material —



cement, steel, paints, pipes
and many others — a boon
for the manufacturers.
A ready and available
market will directly increase
jobs as factories ramp up
production. Indirectly,
jobs will be created from
increased consumption
of inputs and jobs that
are created along the
distribution chain.
However, the government
has to put in place certain
measures that will ensure
that we do not create jobs on
one hand and export jobs on
the other.
Exporting jobs can happen
if we allow the unbridled
importation of inputs,
especially in cases where
there are local companies
that can produce the same
goods at a higher quality.
The paint industry, for
example, should be protected
through local content
laws that would compel
international construction
companies to use Kenyanmade paints in cases where
these products meet the
required technological
standards.
Additionally, the use of
lead- and chrome-free paints
that are environmentally
friendly should be enforced
and regulated by the
government to promote



If such initiatives
are encouraged by all
stakeholders, then the
country will be in the right
direction with regards to
economic development and
self-sustenance.
The manufacturing and
housing sectors will blossom
to their potential and,
by extension, enable the
government to realise two of
the Big Four pillars.
Done right, the
manufacturing and
affordable housing pillars
are set to become the
silver bullets for the acute
unemployment facing Kenya.
On a separate note, as the
government technocrats and
policy makers begin drafting
the Big Four blueprint, it
is worth noting that the
country has made some
headway towards improving
infrastructure, which is
necessary to make it a 24hour economy.
Projects such as the
standard gauge railway
(SGR) are reducing the
cost of transportation while
increased power connectivity
gives rise to 24 extended
trading hours across the
country.

of Nasa offshoot National Resistance Movement
– deported to Canada.
Sources in the diplomatic, religious and business circles who pushed for talks between the two
sides have spoken of a deal that once looked so
close but now so far but which they believe can
be revived. Nasa had also wanted the business
and religious community teams, assembled by
diplomats, reconstituted as they argued that they
were largely pro-Jubilee.
The Opposition wanted Anglican Archbishop
Jackson ole Sapit and the Kisumu catholic bishop
Zacheaus Okoth included in the religious team.
Further, they felt the team needed to be leaner
otherwise it would be a talking shop.
On Friday, the church was still pushing the
two politicians to talk the country out of the
impasse.
At some stage, the Central Organisation of
Trade Unions also joined the fray with its secretary-general Francis Atwoli writing to both Mr
Kenyatta and Mr Odinga pleading with them to
meet and avert a looming crisis.
Mr Atwoli was later to say although the Nasa
leader responded declaring readiness to talk, the
President did not.
Before the situation deteriorated, the US
embassy reported that America had already set
aside Sh60 million for the talks, with Germany
and UK also expected to put in more.
Yesterday, Mr Odinga expressed rare hope
that despite the growing rift between them and
the government side, it was not impossible to
have talks.
“It remains our hope in Nasa that Jubilee will
come out of denial and accept that this country
is too divided and too bitter at the state of our
politics to move forward. The country is being
held back by people in Jubilee who think that
being declared a winner and handed so-called
instruments of power is all it takes to run a
country. That is the group that promised us a
rough five years in the name of benevolent dictatorship. It won’t work and this country should
have started a conversation with itself yesterday,”
he told _Sunday Nation_ .
As the situation has degenerated in recent days,
the fate of the dialogue remains unknown with
high-ranking Jubilee leaders like the DP saying
time for politicking was over and it was time the
country got down to work.
Jubilee vice chairman David Murathe insisted
that their position concerning dialogue had not
changed and they were opposed to any engagements with Nasa concerning the last polls.
Last week, Mr Ruto said at the burial of Ms
Yvonne Wamalwa, the widow of the vice president Wamalwa Kijana that the window for talks
had closed. “We are ready to talk to our friends
in the Opposition on how millions of Kenyans
can get jobs, eliminate food insecurity, how to
transform the National Hospital Insurance Fund,
accessible healthcare and manufacturing among
other development projects. That’s the discussion
we want. But dialogue on who will be the Deputy
President or President, or who will be who. We are
not qualified. It’s the people who decide and they
decided last year that President Uhuru Kenyatta
is their President. That’s all,” the DP said.
In their response to the “swearing-in”, both the
EU and US demanded that Kenyans embark on
dialogue to save the country and end tension.
They further faulted Mr Odinga for disregarding
their caution on the move.
In an op-ed published elsewhere in this paper,
the western envoys yesterday renewed calls for
the country to have a “national conversation”.
They regretted that both the government and
the Opposition had taken steps that had undermined Kenya’s institutions, and driven wedges
among its citizens.
“The government, which should be the guarantor of liberty and freedom of expression for all
under the law, has shut down television stations,
seized the passports of opposition leaders, refused
to obey court orders, and deported a prominent
opposition lawyer. These events follow two elections that left many Kenyans dead and many more
livelihoods disrupted,” they said.

t is a much-storied political dynasty rivalry,
but the history of the love-hate relationship
〇〇〇

keeps turning new chapters with the latest instalment playing out in the ongoing political standoff
with a remarkable sense of _deja vu_ .
Last week, President Uhuru Kenyatta and his
political rival Mr Raila Odinga once again re-lived
the duel that their fathers – founding President
Mzee Jomo Kenyatta and his first Vice-President
Jaramogi Oginga Odinga – started more than half
a century ago.
The parallels between the contest of the fathers
and sons range from the mundane – such as the
similarity in ages – to the profound, like how
the conflict is shaping national politics and the
country’s future.
Consider this interesting fact: In terms of age,
Uhuru and Raila find themselves on the opposite
sides of where their fathers were at the peak of
their political duels. Jaramogi was 55 when he
resigned as vice-president in 1966 while Jomo
was 75.
More than a half century later, the age factor
is flipped: Raila is now 73 – roughly the same age
Jomo was in 1966 – while Uhuru is 56, just a year
older than Jaramogi was at the time of the fallout
with the founding President.
What has remained constant in these dynastic duels is that the balance of power has firmly
remained in favour of the Kenyattas. Of more
importance, however, is how the two generations
of the Kenyattas have handled the challenge to
their authority by the Odingas and how this has
shaped Kenya’s history. In this regard, Uhuru has
proved that, indeed, the apple does not fall far
from the tree.
The move by Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred
Matiang’i to declare National Resistance Movement (NRM) – associated with Raila’s Nasa – an
illegal group mirrors the outlawing of Jaramogi’s
Kenya People’s Union (KPU) by Jomo 47 years
ago.
After resigning as VP, Jaramogi formed KPU,
which became the official opposition to Jomo’s
ruling Kanu party. However, the State employed
every trick in the book to harass the party’s followers.
Security agencies monitored the movements of
KPU officials, limited their international travel by
withdrawing their passports, and fired civil servants perceived to be supportive of the party.
Jomo himself led the onslaught against KPU,
branding it a clandestine organisation. “If anybody
dares to spoil the party that fought for _uhuru_
(independence), he will be dealt with firmly. We
shall crush him into powder,” Jomo warned at a
public rally.
Following the deaths and chaos that broke out
on October 25, 1969 between KPU supporters
and Jomo’s security guards during a presidential visit to Kisumu, Jomo moved swiftly to bring
Jaramogi to heel.
Two days after the incident, Jaramogi was
placed under house arrest for a year and KPU
was banned five days later, thus returning Kenya
to a one-party State. In efforts to rein in Jaramogi,
Jomo amassed sweeping powers that made him
an imperial president, a later source of many of
Kenya’s ills.
The situation has changed considerably from
Jomo’s days, with the enactment in 2010 of a
robust Constitution that protects freedoms. But
events of recent days suggest that the more things
change, the more they remain the same.
Uhuru has waged a campaign against the Opposition, media, Judiciary and the civil society,
which he accuses of unfairly targeting him and
working on behalf of his opponents.

Attorney-General Githu Muigai cautioned that it
was “high treason”.
Last week, the government arrested several
Nasa MPs who played key roles in Raila’s largely
symbolic “swearing-in” on January 30. It remains
to be seen whether Uhuru will carry out his AG’s
threat and detain the Nasa leader, just like his
father Jomo did in 1969.
The conflict between Jomo and Jaramogi
took place under the shadow of the Cold War
pitting the West against the communist USSR.
The two Kenyan protagonists became pawns in
the global struggle for domination by the two

superpowers.
While Jomo eschewed communism in favour of
capitalism, Jaramogi, who had been a darling of
the West before independence, threw in his lot
with the Soviets.
One of the peripheral players in the Cold War
was China, a communist state with its own designs in Africa. A large but poor country at the
time, China still vied with the Russians and the
Americans for influence in Kenya.
Jomo, with the help of the US, moved to limit
China’s support for Jaramogi. Kanu mandarins
termed the “Red Dragon’s” embassy in Nairobi
“Agent No1 of subversive activities”. But 50 years
later, things have changed. Today, China is a global
superpower. While Jomo turned his back on China,
his son Uhuru has fully embraced the Asian giant
and it is now shaping his legacy.
It has already done so by delivering Uhuru’s
first term signature project: the standard gauge
railway, whose first phase between Mombasa and
Nairobi was built in a record four years at a cost

target date if the benefi ts
accruing from the standard
gauge railway (SGR) are
anything to go by.
A year after its
inauguration, the SGR is on
the path to steering Kenya to
greater heights of economic
development. Nothing
exemplifi es this better than
the fact that, since July 10, it
has been operating 14 freight
trains daily between Nairobi
and Mombasa.
With a single train pulling
up to 54 vehicles carrying
108 twenty-foot equivalent
unit (TEU) containers in
a single direction, this
translates into 756 TEU
containers a day. The
transportation capacity has
increased sevenfold from the
two trains a day early in the

year.
Still, more good news
is on the way with the
projection of operating
28 freight trains daily this
year. The upshot is that
the 2025 target for freight
container numbers has
been reached. Signifi cantly,
the SGR has achieved
the eight-year container
transportation plan within
a year. By operating 14

Besides his fi ery anti-apartheid campaigns, former South African President
Nelson Mandela, whose 100th birthday
the world is celebrating this year, was
also a famed advocate for public health.
Mandela fought for universal health
coverage, in which quest he achieved
milestones. The numerous achievements
by the Nobel laureate in this line are just
a sneak peek into how much a nation’s
leader can infl uence policies and systems
in health.
The anti-apartheid icon also openly
talked about HIV/Aids and various mitigations to curb the scourge. He promoted
the use of condoms as contraceptives
in order to prevent it and discouraged
stigmatisation of people living with the
disease.
At the 2000 International Aids Conference, Mandela asked the world to move
away from minor disputes and political
issues that distract attention from serious
life and death issues, such as HIV/Aids.
He pledged South African resources to
stop the spread of the disease.
Mandela was also the chair of The
Vaccine Fund Board, where he advocated
universal vaccinations for needy children.
Promotion of health is a combined
eff ort; so, our leaders need to be involved.
We should not forget the successful
fi ghts that Mandela — an amateur boxer
in his youth — fought and won for public
health. The best way to honour Mandela
would be by emulating him.



Railways Training Institute
(RTI) in Nairobi before
entering the positions. After
they graduate, the company
will also carry out daily, fulltime on-the-job training.
According to the Kenya
Railways’ plan, the SGR
is poised to start the
transportation of bulk cargo
next month and, with a
target to operate 28 freight
trains by the end of the
year, achieving an annual
transportation capacity of
10 million tonnes by 2024
as stipulated in the original
agreement.
If the SGR meets this
target of 28 freight trains,
more could be introduced
next year, thereby increasing
the throughput of the
port and attracting freight
source from the ports
in other countries. That
would further enhance the
importance of Mombasa
in Africa and its strategic
position.
Ultimately, the economy is
set to grow at a tremendous
rate. This is the pre-eminent
goal of the SGR project and
also the aspiration of the
Kenyan people.

tions adviser at China Road &
Bridge Corporation (CRBC)



SGR has fully utilised the
advantages of MNSGR for
its large volume, safe and
comfortable, punctual and
fast characteristics, reducing
700 trucks a day, which
were to transport heavy and
empty containers between
Mombasa and Nairobi.
It has, eff ectively,
alleviated the tense traffi c
conditions on the Mombasa
highway and greatly
shortened the time limit for
cargo transportation, which
is fi ve hours faster than that
of highway transport. More
importantly, it has increased
cargo transportation
effi ciency and reduced
maintenance frequency and
cost of road infrastructure.
Above all, the clearance
of goods at the inland
container depot (ICD)
in Nairobi has eased the
pressure on centralised
customs clearance at
Mombasa Port and improved
effi ciency.


**A train every 45 minutes**
Put another way,
operating 14 freight and
four passenger trains per
day means there is a train
at each terminus every 45
minutes. That necessitates
robust equipment and a
suffi cient number of highly



expertise in train operations,
driving, maintenance,
vehicle operations and cargo
handling to ensure safe and
smooth operations.
For instance, for each
additional two freight trains,
it is necessary to increase
14 Chinese locomotive
drivers and 14 Kenyan
assistant drivers. When the
total number of trains is
eventually increased to 14,
operations will run evenly

It will also increase the
number of workers in
loading and unloading,

inspection and maintenance
inspection of electrical
equipment and ensure the
employees meet the job
conditions.
The SGR has recruited
2,285 staff ers from diverse
professional backgrounds.
Since the beginning of the
year, the company has also
carried out daily training of
local employees on 1,086
occasions, translating into
17,566 man hours.
Notably, practical
operations training has
been conducted on 749
occasions, or 3,234 man
hours. Since last year, seven
assistant locomotive drivers
and four Kenyan passenger
train attendants have
been enrolled in a training
programme to acquire skills
in China.
Kenya Railways has

this season of the new
coronavirus. Even before
the Covid-19 disease, Kenya
was in a bad place, which the
virus can only make worse.
Our public debt, especially,
has soared apace over the
past seven years. This is a
factor of what can only be
described as impulsive and
poorly planned borrowing,
which I have been against.
The State has failed to
shop around for the best
money on the market. We
have not taken advantage of
the most reasonable facilities
available. In eff ect, we have
borrowed on commercial
terms when concessionary
loans were available.
Throughout last year, and
in 2018, I repeatedly spoke
about this vexed matter. In
one press function after the
other, I desperately pleaded
with those in government to
blunt their appetite for debt.
I also called for the need for
openness in borrowing.
Responsible borrowing
requires that the people be
given the details of the funds
to be borrowed on their
behalf. They need to know
the quantum and nature of
the loan, the interest and


〇〇〇

Much as most Kenyans appreciate
every eff ort to contain the spread of
Covid-19, the government should never
use archaic methods against the people.
First the government unleashed
armed police on defenceless innocent
civilians trying to make a delicate balance between earning their daily bread
and staying safe from the deadly virus.
It followed that up with harsh fi nes and
prison sentences for failure to wear a
face mask or violating the curfew rules,
especially in locked-down counties. And
now, it will forcibly quarantine, for 14
days, those who break curfew rules — on
the assumption that they are infected.
Statements like “Observe the curfew
rules or we take you into forced quarantine!” are punitive and stigmatising.
The government seems to have turned
isolation centres into prisons to teach
indisciplined Kenyans a lesson — which
has proved true to some 500 people so
far. Worse, accounts on social media
say the police are threatening those
they arrest for any off ence with forced
quarantine if they don’t bribe them.
But the iron-fi sted route always produces the opposite results. Draconian
measures will not curb the spread of the
virus. We need inspirational leadership
which, using every communication
channel, convinces Kenyans on the need
to follow safety guidelines and provides
protective gear such as face masks, soap



Besides seeking realistic
schedules, some of the debts
ought to be converted from
commercial to concessionary
loans or written off . This is
especially so for Chinese
loans — such as those for
the standard gauge railway
(SGR). They don’t make
sense and must be reviewed.
But, apart from the
grotesqueness of these
loans, China, as the
springboard of Covid-19,
owes Kenya some level of
compassion and comfort.
It has a moral obligation
to open up the space for
renegotiation.
Finally, the government
must publish the full
schedule of the public debt.
These borrowings are not
personal debt for those
who negotiated them. The
taxpayer, who is repaying
them, has a right to know.
Just how deep are these
pits? How long will it take
to fi ll them up? What are
the penalties for delay or
default? How have the debts
been collateralised? Does the
country risk losing strategic
national assets?
We need openness on all
these and other questions.


Mr Mudavadi, party leader of
Amani National Congress (ANC),



know why we are borrowing.
After all, this becomes the
people’s money — and debt.
Our laws provide for
public participation in
fi nance-related decisions.
They also provide for
openness on the part of
the government, and the
citizen’s right to information.
Public debt is the one
area where it is especially
important for the people to
know what is happening.
The State is, eternally and
primarily, the custodian of
public fi nance and spending
on behalf of the citizens.
The details around
borrowed public funds
should not dwell in secrecy.
There are very few occasions
when sensitivity to state
security may allow nondisclosure at the time. But
even then, proper detailed
records of accounts must be
kept, to be made public in
the fullness of time, in line
with the Offi cial Secrets Act.


**Casual handling**
Our rather casual handling
of these matters has put
Kenya in a terrible place.
Public debt has come back
to bite us. It is time to
repay some of these debts
— especially to China, our
single-largest lender.


〇〇〇





rescheduling with China
and some of our other major
bilateral and multilateral
lenders and commercial
creditors, including those
in the Eurobond market.
However, my pleas ended up
as the dialogue of the deaf.
Rather than look for
better ways of managing our
situation, the State elected
to dig new pits to fi ll up old
ones. When the national debt
hit the permitted ceiling
of Sh6 trillion, Parliament
was prevailed upon to raise
it to Sh9 trillion. What



the borrowing ceiling and
Parliament was only rubberstamping and legitimising
it. In this case, Parliament
failed the people.
I’ve urged in the past,
and I do so, once again, for
the need to establish an
independent public debt
management institution.
Today, the function rests
with a small offi ce in the
National Treasury — in
fact, one desk. This desk
is completely neutered;
it cannot do much to
manage public borrowing.
An Independent Public
Borrowing Authority would
bring sobriety to state
borrowing.


**Debt rescheduling**
Meanwhile, the AuditorGeneral’s offi ce has
repeatedly shown that much
of this money cannot be
accounted for. In this season
of coronavirus, it is going to
be diffi cult for us to meet our
public debt commitments.
We have far too many
challenges in our hands.
It was, therefore, good to
hear President Kenyatta, at
last, say on Thursday last
week that the government is
exploring debt rescheduling.
While it comes a little
late, better late than never.

n March 22, I arrived
in Nairobi to start
〇〇〇

16th Chinese Ambassador
to Kenya and Permanent
Representative to Unep and
UN-Habitat.
Already, I have travelled to
several cities, visited projects,
including the MombasaNairobi Standard Gauge
Railway (SGR) and met
with some Kenyan friends
from diff erent walks of life.
I am delighted to notice the
thriving development in
every sector here, verifi ed
by the hustle and bustle on
construction sites.
I sincerely admire the
great achievements made by
the Kenyan government and
people. I feel strongly that
the China-Kenya relations are
experiencing unprecedented
opportunities. It’s my honour
to be accredited to Kenya at
this particular time, when all
conditions are favourable to
foster even stronger ties.
I am at the right place.
Kenya enjoys unique
and favourable natural
conditions and a diversifi ed
culture, which endows itself
with vigour and vitality.
Since independence, the
hardworking Kenyan people
have developed this fertile
land into a hub for trade,
fi nance, transportation and



in East Africa. Kenya is
playing an increasingly
essential role in both
international and regional
aff airs. Towards Vision
2030 and Big Four Agenda
proposed by President
Kenyatta, people from all
sectors are striving for
achievements, which is
changing Kenya in a better
way every passing day.
It’s a good time for me
to be here. The ChinaKenya relationship is at its
fi nest in history. President
Xi Jinping and President
Kenyatta have strengthened
China-Kenya relations into
Comprehensive Strategic
Cooperative Partnership.
The second Belt and Road
Forum for International
Cooperation (BRF) will be
held in Beijing later this
month, when President
Kenyatta will once again visit
China to meet with President
Xi and other state leaders.
The second China
International Import Expo
will be held in Shanghai
this November, which
would bring about another
promotion opportunity for
Kenyan coff ee, tea, fl owers

Since January, many deaths caused
by hunger have been reported. About 23
counties have been aff ected, with Turkana
and Baringo the hardest hit. Hunger is the
direct cause of the deaths, but is drought
the cause of the hunger?
Born and brought up in Baringo
County, I feel the issue is totally misdiagnosed. The government and the media
attribute the hunger to drought. Try and
read in between the lines and you realise
that poverty is the root killer.
The misdiagnosis often leads to the
wrong prescription. In the past few weeks,
relief food has been given to the aff ected.
Relief food is no diff erent from administering fi rst aid, which on own lacks the
ability to cure regardless of the number
of times it’s administered.
The remedy is economic empowerment. Most people living in these areas
are pastoralists. Industries should be set
up to support local economic activities.
Meat processing plants need to be set
up to support livestock rearing alongside
tanning industries.
In Baringo, Turkana and West Pokot,
bee keeping is popular. Set up honey processing plants. These areas are also rich
in their cultures and traditions, therefore,
centres should be set up to promote the
manufacture of traditional ornaments for
export. Industries will create jobs and
improve living standards.

time, over 81,000 Chinese
tourists travelled to Kenya.
This month, 55 outstanding
Kenyan employees picked
by Chinese enterprises are
fl ying to China for a oneweek visit. We believe they
would enjoy hospitality of the
Chinese people, witnessing
China’s development and
achievements, and pushing
forward more cooperation.
China-Kenya relations
are standing at a higher
stage with new development
opportunities. I will live up
to my mission and make
into full play the favourable
conditions of “good timing,

_suing title deeds to fi ve countries_
_to establish dry ports in Naivasha,_

_nfrastructure is crucially important to fos-_
_tering countries’ economic development_
_and prosperity. Investments in infrastruc-_
_ture contribute to higher productivity and_
_growth, facilitate trade and connectivity,_
〇〇〇

_Quality infrastructure guarantees high-_
_er production and productivity and ensures_
_easier movement of goods and raw materi-_
_als, reducing inefficiency and leading to ef-_
_ficient use of scarce resources, besides elimi-_
_nating wastage. Socially, it connects commu-_
_nities and countries with market, health and_
_education facilities, gives access to clean wa-_
_ter, sanitation and power and improves live-_
_lihoods and generates employment, thus cre-_
_ating conditions for lasting peace._
_When President Kenyatta took over the_
_reins of power in 2013, he was acutely aware_
_of the crucial role infrastructure would play_
_in the country’s growth trajectory and ce-_
_menting his legacy. His ‘Big Four Agenda’ de-_
_velopment blueprint comprising food se-_
_curity, affordable housing, manufacturing_
_and universal health coverage could not be_
_achieved without adequate investment in in-_
_frastructure. He, therefore, embarked on an_
_ambitious infrastructure development pro-_
_gramme that has seen the country achieve_
_massive development in the past 10 years._
_The transport sector, no doubt, has taken a_
_huge chunk of the investment, notably in the_
_standard gauge railway (SGR), a modern, effi-_
_cient transport system that has enabled safe,_
_comfortable travel for individuals and freight_
_across the region at lower costs. The most im-_
_mediate impact of SGR, operated by Afristar,_
_includes reliable and high capacity transport,_
_reduced freight tariff and decongested roads,_
_leading to savings in road maintenance, de-_



_congested port, skills transfer and more em-_
_ployment opportunities through industries_
_coming up along the railway line._
_The SGR has already put Kenya on the path_
_to industrialisation, especially in manufac-_
_turing and value addition._
_One of the key infrastructure landmarks_
_benefiting from the SGR is the Port of Mom-_
_basa, where construction of a second contain-_
_er terminal has seen throughput increase_
_from 894,000 to 1.1 million Twenty-Foot_
_Equivalent Units. That makes it the fifth-busi-_
_est port in Africa._
_With the port facilitating over 90 per cent_
_of our international sea trade, it’s imperative_
_that the turnaround time for cargo from the_
_port to its destination is reduced. In this re-_
_spect, the expansion of the port would not_
_have been possible without the SGR, whose_
_regulator, Kenya Railways Corporation, has_
_stepped up decongestion of the port._
_The President also recently commissioned_
_the Lamu Port-South Sudan-Ethiopia Trans-_
_port (Lapsset) corridor, one of the region’s_
_largest infrastructure projects._









_Covering 1,000 acres, it incorporates the La-_
_mu sea port, international airport, highway_
_and SGR line to South Sudan and Ethiopia, oil_
_refinery, resort city and optical fibre._
_Investment in the road network has also_
_been scaled up to build more highways and_
_urban roads and extend rural roads to open_
_up areas to economic activity, trade and com-_
_merce. The highlight, though, is the Nairo-_
_bi Expressway, which is nearing completion._
_The 27km four-lane dual carriageway will_
_link Mlolongo and JKIA to the Nairobi-Naku-_
_ru highway. It’s part of the Northern Corridor_
_that provides passage to 85 per cent of the_
_cargo to landlocked countries._
_Kenya’s Affordable Housing Programme,_
_launched in December 2017, promises to_
_deliver 500,000 affordable homes over five_
_years. It is expected to be implemented on_
_7,000 acres in five cities, namely Nairobi,_
_Mombasa, Kisumu, Nakuru and Eldoret._
_With rapidly changing global technological_
_development, the government has laid down_
_over 6,000km of the National Optic Fibre_
_Backbone across all the 47 counties._
_Kenya has joined the Smart Africa Initia-_
_tive Alliance, which will leverage technology_
_to create a single digital market in the conti-_
_nent. The initiative covers 24 countries with a_
_population of 600 million._
_The Presidential Digital Talent Programme,_
_provides one-year paid internships to ICT_
_and engineering graduates to develop skilled_
_human capital to support digital capacity._
_One can only hope that President Kenyatta’s_
_successor will carry on with his legacy proj-_
_ects to spur more economic growth._

_This is not the first time the country is witness-_
_ing violence between neighbouring commu-_

_climatic conditions, resources and at times, pol-_
_itics. Every year, the problem gets more compli-_
_cated, just as the people involved. In one of the_
_security forums, it was recently suspected that_
_an aircraft could be supplying arms to the felons._
_In many of the counties where residents have_
_been attacked, it’s evident that the prevalent_
_weather conditions aren’t conducive. This could_
_largely be blamed on climate variability. Pro-_
_ductivity of land has transmuted for the worse,_
_thereby, leading to illegal enforcement of the_
_rule of the jungle. Basically, it’s survival of the fit-_
_test and, in this case, those that have the most so-_
_phisticated weaponry carry the day._
_Traditional farming methods can’t withstand_
_the test of time; residents watch the sun rise and_
_set and, in the same breadth, see young seed-_
_lings succumb to the scorching sun._
_Pastoralists set off for greener pastures far_
_away. For the fortunate few, they bring back_
_healthier livestock and, for the unlucky ones,_
_they are gunned down and their herds driven_
_away. The less valuable livestock, such as don-_
_keys and dogs, starve to death._
_This pattern is repeated until it could be mis-_
_taken for a lifestyle. It’s time we devolved solu-_
_tions to the affected residents. They should learn_
_peace and practise coexistence. They should be_
_inducted into climate-smart agriculture, receive_
_urgent food aid and be accorded added security._

Among the projects planned
are the establishment of a
special economic zone (SEZ) in
Miritini, the establishment of
an automobile park, putting up
“biashara” and value-addition
centres, and modernising a
market in Makupa.
The projects will cost
Mombasa taxpayers an
estimaated Sh545 million.
The special economic in
Mombasa West will be set up at
a cost of Sh200 million, while
two biashara centres and a
value-addition centre will cost
Sh125 million.
The vehicle park, to be built
in Changamwe, will cost Sh100
million and will include a vehicle
assembly plant and showrooms.
The market in Makupa will
be upgraded to a two-storey
building with a basement
parking at a cost Sh120 million.
According to the county’s

Mr Hamza Ibrahim, a car

“Town has been the easiest

Meanwhile, market traders

Most of the traders have

President Yoweri Museveni and
his South Sudan counterpart Salvir Kirr were in the country and
confi rmed that President Uhuru
Kenyatta had given them land in
Naivasha for the construction
of a dry port, which the Maasai
are laying claim to as the land
of their ancestors.
The construction of the port
in Naivasha by the two countries
will act as a base for their cargo
that docks at Kenya’s port of
Mombasa.
In the case fi led at the constitution and human rights division
of the High Court in Nairobi
dated October 11, 2019, the
community is alleging contravention of fundamental rights
and freedom as provided in the
Constitution.
“Article 28 of the Constitution
provides that every person has
inherent dignity and the right to
have that dignity respected and
protected. The petitioners are
entitled to dignity as protected
by the Constitution and all acts
that violate this dignity stand in
violation of the Constitution,”
argued the petitioners.
Mr Raphael Kerenke, Mr
Lunke Kapiani, Mr Simon Punyua, Patrick Kirotie, Mr John
Maloi and 12 others, on behalf
of the community, argue that
historically, the Maasai community lived in the land and the
parcel has always been home to
30,000 families.
They are apprehensive that
further government projects on
the disputed land as well as the
exercise of property rights by
Kedong Ranch will undermine
their rights.

the ranch ownership, those representing community interests
led by Kitet community said the
high court judge failed to consider “historical and legitimate
claim and occupation of the suit
land by the Maasai community
to which they belong thereby
violating their constitutional
rights to property, socio-economic rights, and their right to
practice their culture.”
The group said the Maasai
community will continue to face
imminent threats of eviction,
reduction and loss of grazing
land and possible loss of ancestral land.
Two weeks ago, the community received a notice to vacate



the land to allow the project to
commence along the Standard
Gauge Railway corridor.
A court order read to more
than 1,000 elders at a meeting in Suswa states that those
occupying the 78,000 acres
of the parcel have been given
a 90-day notice to leave or be
evicted by force.
The eviction caused anxiety
among families hin the controversial ranch forcing them to
move back to court to obtain an
injunction to stop the eviction.
During construction of SGR,
the National Land Commission
compensated some residents living on the land. The petitioners
claim recently the government
earmarked the land for development of the proposed Naivasha
Dry Port without compensating
the aff ected community.
Speaking during the elders’
meeting in Suswa, Narok East
MP Lemanken Aramat said
the consent order to allow
compensation was signed by a
few individuals who claimed to
represent the whole community.
“The notice was signed by
a group of four individuals; as
a community we are not party
to that. It’s written that they
received Sh10m from Kedong
Limited as community trustees,
this is fraud and they should be
arrested, that money went to
their pockets,” he said.
Kedong Ranch that cuts
through Naivasha to Suswa is
worth Sh20 billion and sits at
the core of geothermal energy."

Locomotive driver’s
mother says son was
cheerful the previous
night, just after dinner


**BY ELVIS ONDIEKI**


eondieki@ke.nationmedia.com


**AND JOSIAH ODANGA**

j.odanga17@gmail.com


he family of a 33-year-old engineer who mysteriously died at
〇〇〇
manded answers from his employer.
The initial story provided to Innocent Nyang’au Ratemo’s family was
that he started vomiting after taking
dinner on June 19 before dying the
following day.
But a couple of days later, the
narrative from Africa Star Railway
Operations changed.
The family was told that Ratemo
fell from his bed around 4.30am on
June 20 and died at noon.
As an Africa Star employee — the
company that is in charge of passenger transport and freight services
on the Mombasa-Nairobi Standard
Gauge Railway (SGR) — Ratemo
and his colleagues spent the night in



conditions anyone would consider
safe.
Africa Star is a subsidiary of
China Road and Bridge Corporation
and its employees often use CRBC
facilities for accommodation.
That night, Ratemo and his
colleagues were at the Port Reitz
houses of the CRBC. They had just
travelled from Nairobi and were expected to be up early the following
day.
The engineer’s mother, Mary
Ratemo Atuti, remembers a call her
son made at about 9pm on the eve
of his death. “He said they had taken
dinner. My son said he was going to
rest and never spoke of vomiting,”
Mrs Atuti told the _Nation_ .
Around 9am the following morning, an employee of Africa Star
called Mrs Atuti to inform her that
her son had been taken ill.
“She said he was critically ill. She
then gave me a phone number of
someone who was with him,” she
said.
That would be the start of a long
journey that would eventually lead
Mrs Atuti and her family to finding
the body of her fifth born son at
Coast General Hospital mortuary.


**Admission number**
Family members flew from Nairobi to Mombasa hoping to get
Ratemo to hospital. They were
shown his body after vain attempts
of locating him at the ICU and the
emergency section of the hospital.
“His name did not have an admission number. That only means
the body was taken to the hospital
through the emergency side,” Mrs
Atuti said.
“The body had head and cheekbone injuries. When the mortuary
attendant attempted to raise it, fresh
blood flowed from the mouth. The
white vest he wore did not have
bloodstains.”
The death had not been reported
to the police and the family does not
know who took Ratemo to hospital.
The postmortem was done on
June 21 after the family made a
formal complaint to the police and
obtained an OB number.
The engineer’s father, Mobesh
Ratemo Atuti, a Chinese employee
of the SGR and another man — a
Kenyan — witnessed the postmortem. When the pathologist opened
his son’s chest, they noticed that the
sternum was broken, said Mr Atuti.
“His death was as a result of a
blow to the chest,” Mr Atuti told the
_Nation_ . “His breathing must have
been inhibited.” Upon the discovery
of the chest injury, an argument ensued and the Chinese and his aide
stormed out of the room.
Later, the family was allowed
to take the body and Ratemo was
buried at his parents’ home in Mekenene village, Nyamira County on
July 5.
Mr Atuti said Ratemo had never
disclosed any threats to his life.

his criticism.
Other leaders, mainly
MPs from Mombasa led by
Kisauni legislator Ali Mbogo,
then took up the mantle
to “fight for the people,”
this time their main issue
being the privatization of
part of the port. After few

political rallies, the leaders

Cabinet Secretaries James
Macharia (Transport) and
Fred Matiang’i (Interior).

police brutality as human
rights activists also softened
their stand and the protests
ended.
This month, thanks to
Uganda's opposition to the
mandatory use of the Naivasha inland port, the leaders
have once again come out
guns blazing, protesting.
The government had announced the Naivasha dry

centre for all the transit

was meant to help contain

The compelled usage of

harm the entire economy
of the Coastal region,” said
Mr Nassir.
Mr Ali on his part, blamed



all the problems surrounding
the port issue and the usage

oast leaders have
come under sharp
〇〇〇
dents and business people
for their perceived failure to
fi ght against the transfer of
port operations to the Naivasha inland container depot
on the orders of Transport
Cabinet Secretary James
Macharia.
Though Nyali MP Mohamed Ali has been quite
vocal in the calls for the
removal of the CS and has
even started a process of
impeaching the CS in Parliament, his colleagues are
being accused of siding with
the “oppressor” as residents
face the loss of incomes and
looming poverty.
The war against government directives, especially
around the compulsory use
of the standard gauge railway
(SGR) for containerised
cargo, started in 2016 ahead
to the 2017 General Election.
Then, Mombasa Governor
Hassan Joho was the face of
the opposition against the
President Uhuru Kenyatta’s
orders on the issue.
But when the two settled
their political differences

Representative Aisha Mohammed.
“Today I confirm that I
have tabled my petition to
impeach CS James Macharia
with 90 supporting signatures, which is more than the
threshold,” said Mr Ali on his
update to his followers.
However, Coast political
commentator Prof Hassan
Mwakimako faulted the leaders saying they are all after
their own self-interests and
political gains.
“We have seen what happened to those who started
the fi ght. When they got their
share, they went silent. So
even those who are fi ghting
now, it is because they have
not been given their share,”
said Prof Mwakimako.
He said for some time now,
the leaders have used the port
as a campaign tool.
In reference to Mr Ali’s
petition, Prof Mwakimako
said it is also not addressing
the issues for the people,
but fighting to remove an
individual.
“The petition by Ali is
mainly accusing the CS over
his failure to implement key
infrastructures including
bridges. It is just because the
issue of port and SGR falls in
his docket that is why he (Ali)
is also seen to be fi ghting for
the people,” he said.

before us. We do not want to get into a war of
words with the Executive,” he said
Mr Ruwa denied allegations that he rallied the
MCA's to reject the executive's Sh160 million
supplementary budget to buy relief food.
He instead said he was guided by the House
resolution after several consultations on how to
use the funds.
""I'm acting as a referee with no favours from
either side but to ensure transparency and accountability for the benefi t of the residents,"" he
said, adding that he is not at political war with
the governor.
Meanwhile, some MCAs who spoke to Sunday
Nation on condition of anonymity alleged that
part of the Sh160 million meant for Covid-19
relief food would be misappropriated by being
spent in the forthcoming by-election.
""We were aware of the plans by the executive to
divert the funds to fund the upcoming Msambweni
by-election,"" said one of the MCAs.
Governor Mvurya' administration has fronted
their candidate, fi nance executive Mr Bakari Sebe
to run for the seat that was left vacant after the
demise of MP Suleiman Dori.
Jubilee national chairman Nelson Dzuya recently
paid a courtesy call on Governor Mvurya. The
governor said their discussion centred on the
direction the Jubilee Party was taking.
Talks on the by-elections also featured in their
talks with Jubilee reportedly saying it will not present a candidate for the seat, according to sources.
In the meantime, Mr Mvurya has maintained
that he will not bow to demands by MCAs after a
section of them vowed to remove him from offi ce.
Mr Mvurya and Mr Ruwa have had a war of
words after the county Assembly allocated the
emergency fund for food Sh5 million instead of
the proposed Sh160 million.
""The Assembly made the appropriation after
consulting experts and residents on the priorities
in combating the Covid-19 pandemic in which
Sh130 million will be used to buy medical supplies,
Sh25 million to be given to water department while
Sh5 million will be for emergencies,"" said Mr Ruwa.



Traditionally, unit trusts have been viewed as secondary
investment plans. Some people still see them that way, yet
today, given the increased sensitivity of economies to world
dynamics, unit trusts are worth paying more attention to for
their advantage in minimising investment risks.


The **Business Daily**, will discuss this in more detail through
a special supplement involving unit trust stakeholders in

Embattled Kwale Governor Salim Mvurya is
not sitting pretty in offi ce even as he fi ghts to
complete his fi nal term.
For the better part of last week, Mr Mvurya was
a man under siege with Members of the County
Assembly once again plotting to impeach him.
The impeachment plan is alleged to be as a
result of diff erences between Mr Mvurya and the
MCAs over a Sh160 million supplementary budget.
A similar attempt was made in 2015 by the ward
reps, who then accused him of withholding Sh40
million bursary funds. The governor survived the
onslaught then.
The new war, the Sunday Nation has learnt, is
due to, among other reasons, the 2022 succession
politics and the Msambweni seat by-election.
Speaker Sammy Ruwa, who is leading the MCAs
in the plot to oust Mr Mvurya, on Wednesday
said he will run for the governor's seat in 2022.
Mr Ruwa, who lost to Mr Mvurya in the 2017
governorship race, while addressing media outside the assembly buildings in Kwale town, said:
“I will be on the ballot in 2022 and anybody is
constitutionally allowed to go for any political
seat,"" he said.
A source who spoke to Sunday Nation revealed
that the move is one of the opposition’s strategies
to counter the governor.
“The budget is just something that is being
used to deal with him. It is not the real reason for
his impeachment. Succession politics is in play,”
said the source.
On Wednesday afternoon, Mr Mvurya was
expected to appear before the assembly, but the
sitting was rescheduled to allow him “time to prepare” after he presented a letter to the assembly.
Mr Ruwa said a seven member committee,
which will be chaired by Andrew Mulei, has been
formed to give recommendations to the assembly.
“We have decided to give the governor reasonable time to prepare his brief and respond to the
issues we raised when we requested him to appear

While this has necessitated

Kiambu Senator Kimani Wamatangi has urged the government
to consider expanding the old
Nanyuki railway line that cuts
through Nairobi, Kiambu, Muran’ga, Kirinyaga, Nyeri and
Laikipia counties in order to
tap into the counties’ economic
potential.
Mr Wamatangi chairs the Senate Committee on Transport and
Infrastructure. The government,
he said, should ensure that the
railway matches the ongoing multi-billion-shilling Standard Gauge



corridor. The Nairobi-Nanyuki line
has been in disuse for some two
decades, but the senator believes
its revival will promote economic
growth in the region and beyond
by facilitating the movement
of goods and attracting more
investors.
The county governments of
Nairobi, Kiambu, Murang’a, Kirinyaga, Nyeri, Laikipia, Nyandarua
and Isiolo, in a proposal championed by then Nyeri Governor



Wahome Gakuru, agreed last year
to commit Sh25 billion to the
revival of the 240-kilometre line.
They would start by contributing Sh100 million each to
jump-start the use of the line to
boost inter-county trade.
Mr Wamatangi also said the
government should revive the
Nairobi-Nyahururu railway line,
which cuts through Limuru, Gilgil
and Nyandarua.
“If the projects were to be implemented, they would open up
the region for business and attract
more investors, leading to a rapid

The government has warned
landowners along the Standard
Gauge Railway (SGR) corridor in
Narok County against inflating
prices, thus delaying completion of the multibillion-shilling
project.
The delay has been caused by
a deadlock between the National
Land Commission (NLC) and
the residents whose land had
been acquired for the project.
Narok County Commissioner
George Natembeya — who led a
team of Kenya Railways officials
in a tour of the project in Suswa,
Narok East Sub-County — decried the exorbitant pricing by
three landowners at Olasiti.
The government’s reaction
came after Phase 2A of SGR-Nairobi-Narok (Emurutoto) stalled
when two families refused to
allow the railway to pass through
their land despite being paid a
total of Sh22 million, with one
taking home Sh13 million and
Sh9 million in an initial payout.
“SGR is a government’s flagship project and it serves all
Kenyans. It is sad that some individuals want to take advantage
of this to demand outrageous
amounts for selfish gain. This
will not be entertained,” said Mr
Natembeya.
According to sources close to
the three landowners, they are
demanding a whopping Sh36
million each to allow the railway
line to pass through their land.
Mr Natembeya — who was
accompanied by Kenya Railways senior surveyor Geoffrey
Wekesa — said NLC would only
pay compensation after proper
valuation to avoid benefitting



unscrupulous owners.
A section of the landowners
have vowed never to move out
until the government agrees to
their compensation demands.
The two families sit on an
18.4-acre parcel of land where
the 120km stretch of the Nairobi-Emurtoto SGR line is
expected to pass.
One the landowners, Mr Korei
Punyua, said he was ready to
negotiate with the NLC to come
up with an amicable solution that
would favour both sides.
“This is the land that I have
called home for the past 20
years. I have submitted my
compensation proposal to the
NLC for approval,” said Mr
Punyua, who declined to reveal
the amount of money he was
seeking from the government.
He said the affected families
were ready to co-operate with the
government, saying they would
not wish to see a situation where
the government uses force to
move them out.
The railway will pass through
Nairobi, Kajiado, Kiambu, Nakuru, Narok and Naivaisha. Five
stations will be built at Ongata
Rongai, Ngong, Mai Mahiu,
Suswa and Nachu.
Mr Wekesa, the Kenya
Railways surveyor, said the
construction of Phase 2A of the
SGR project was 75 per cent
complete and was expected to
be launched for operations in
June 2019.

Residents accuse officers
of harassment and only
responding to raids
targeting illicit brews


**BY BENSON AMADALA**

bamadala@ke.nationmedia.com


t the Khayega Chief’s Camp in
Kakamega County, the capti# A vating beat of an isukuti drum

rents the air, signalling an important
ceremony is about to take place.
The drummer and his troupe of
dancers belt out a traditional tune, one
of the favourites sung during important
occasions — including bullfighting
contests and political rallies — to
attract crowds.
But this time, the solemn change of
guard at the chief’s camp has attracted
only a handful of people as residents
keep their distance from the nearby
Administration Police camp.
They complain of beatings and
harassment following an operation by
law enforcers to arrest suspects linked
to the brutal murder of suspected
criminals at Khayega market.
On an ordinary day, Khayega market
is usually busy, packed with traders
from different parts of Kakamega East
and the neighbouring Kakamega South
Sub-counties.
But in the past three weeks, residents
have been gripped by fear after a
suspected chicken thief was hacked
to death and his body set on fire in an
incident that left residents in shock.
The gruesome attack by machete


wielding suspects was captured
on video as the helpless victim
was repeatedly slashed before he
succumbed to his injuries.
As the suspected thief was mowed
down, law enforcers from Khayega AP
Camp, less than a kilometre away, did
not show up to try and save his life.
At the market, traders told the _Nation_
that recent brutal killings targeting
suspected criminals were sometimes
deliberate and meant to cover up
activities of members of criminal
gangs operating in Kakamega East
Sub-county.
“Some of those who kill suspected
criminals are themselves suspects who
fear they could end up in jail if their
colleagues implicate them in criminal
activities,” said a resident who asked
not to be named, fearing reprisals from
the gangs.
County Police Commander Bernard
Muli said an operation had been
launched to ensure that all suspected
criminals and idlers at the market are
arrested.
“We cannot allow lawlessness to take
control of any part of the county. Our
officers are currently conducting an
operation targeting suspected criminals
linked to killings at the market,” said
Mr Muli.
Acting Khayega Chief Gerald
Murunga said there had been frequent
campaigns by local administrators
urging villagers to hand over suspected
criminals to the authorities, instead of
lynching them.
“It is unfortunate that whenever
suspects are arrested by villagers,
they end up dead within minutes after
being attacked and then set on fire,”
said Mr Murunga.
At Khayega market, there exists
deep mistrust between the police
and residents, who complain that law
enforcers were raiding their homes
at night and beating up and arresting
innocent people.
Isukha South MCA Farouk Machanje
said the AP Camp at Khayega should
be elevated to a police station.
“We have officers at the AP Camp
who only respond to raids targeting
illicit brews but when other emergencies
happen, they are nowhere to be seen,”
said Mr Machanje.
Villagers interviewed at Khayega
said they had lost confidence in
the officers following an upsurge in
criminal activities.
“We are asking Interior CS Fred
Matiang’i to transfer these officers to
other stations and consider setting up
a police station at Khayega market,”
said Mr Machanje, who condemned
the killing of the suspected chicken
thief three weeks ago.
The incident caught the attention
of CS Matiang’i, who ordered police
to investigate and arrest the suspects.
Dr Matiang’i said: “The Government
condemns in the strongest terms
possible, the heinous and outrageous
murder of an adult male that took place
on 12 July, close to Khayega market.”
The CS said 26 suspects, including
an acting chief, were arrested following
a massive operation by the police.

Police hunt for man after

Police are hunting for a man who

at Kariaini village in Murang’a
County. The suspect also injured his
brother during the Tuesday evening
attack. The couple had rushed to
the assailant’s home to rescue a

five dogs to attack him, following
a quarrel over construction beams,
when he slashed them using a
machete. The attacker fled to Gatare

_After a week of mourning, a fam-_
_ily in Othaya has been forced to_
_cancel the burial of their kin af-_
_ter the body went missing from_
_the Outspan Hospital mortuary._
_A dozen mourners had assem-_
_bled at the morgue on Tuesday_
_to collect the body for transpor-_
_tation to Gaturuturu village._
_The body of Ms Monicah Mum-_
_bi, 77, was taken to the facility last_
_week for preservation awaiting_
_the burial on Tuesday._
_But the mourners were_
_shocked when the mortuary at-_
_tendants produced a body of a_
_woman the family could not rec-_
_ognise._


**Shock-stricken**

_The shock-stricken fami-_
_ly members said the two bod-_
_ies have different features, say-_
_ing their relative had white hair,_
_was balding and had some of her_
_teeth missing._
_Ms Loise Wangari, a daughter of_
_the deceased, said they declined_
_to take the body._
_""My mother was using den-_
_tures since she didn’t have some_
_teeth. The dentures were left_
_home when she was brought to_

_they are giving is of a woman_
_with almost all teeth intact. How_
_could we have accepted it?"" Ms_

_fishermen who have been denied_
_the use of the Mtongwe landing_
_site and are effectively rendered_
_jobless for which they seek com-_
_pensation._
_The petitioners state that they_
_were duly licensed and registered_
_with the Ministry of Fisheries._
_“Prior to the commencement_
_of the implementation of the_
_SGR project, the respondent had_
_promised to compensate us for_
_loss of our livelihood after a ver-_
_ification exercise to identify gen-_
_uine affected persons was final-_

_However, they were deliber-_

_lating their right to a fair admin-_

_protected from inhuman treat-_
_ment by condemning them un-_

_Mr Bandari told the court that_
_their chairman refused to renew_
_membership of genuine fisher-_
_men, and embarked on register-_
_ing new members, who were not_
_fishers. “Membership of BMU was_
_permanent. It was the license_
_that was annual, but the identi-_
_fication of members was based_
_on membership and not on the li-_
_cence, which the county refused_
_to issue to fishermen claiming_
_that they were to cease fishing_
_due to the SGR project,” he said_
_He stated that in the list of bene-_
_ficiaries, 13 individuals who were_
_not fishermen or stakeholders_
_were illegally and or wrongly in-_
_cluded while other beneficiar-_
_ies were relatives of the BMU of-_
_ficials._
_In defence, the county and the_
_KRC said the verification process_
_was conducted transparently_
_and that only genuine fishermen_
_identified by a technical commit-_
_tee were compensated in 2016._
_“Petitioners were neither mem-_
_bers of the Mtongwe Beach Unit_
_nor licensed to fish at the site,” the_
_county said._
_KRC through its representative_
_Justine Omoke said the corpora-_
_tion’s duty ended when all the af-_
_fected fishermen, whose names_
_had been submitted by the coun-_
_ty, were compensated._
_“The devolved unit is responsi-_
_ble for licensing the BMU mem-_
_bers, it was the county’s duty to_
_identify genuine fishermen af-_
_fected by the project and to en-_
_sure that they were compensat-_
_ed,” said Mr Omoke._






_Bandari, Mohamed Nuru and_
_Omari Bakari — had sued the_
_county, KRC, the National Land_
_Commission and the Kenya Mar-_
_itime Authority over failure to_
_compensate them despite be-_
_ing affected by the project. They_
_filed the case on behalf of 68 oth-_

_ers._
_The three are among the hun-_
_dreds of local fishermen who_
_were affected when the govern-_
_ment reclaimed 63 acres of land_
_from the Indian Ocean that they_
_depended on for their liveli-_
_hoods. The land was reclaimed_
_to pave way for the construction_
_of a marshalling yard, where_
_2,000 containers would be kept_
_for the rail project._
_The three said they are licensed_



_tive action as no reasons were_
_given to them for the refusal to_
_compensate them._
_He ordered that the fishermen_
_be compensated the same way_
_their unlicensed colleagues were_
_paid. “An order of mandamus_
_is hereby issued directing and_
_compelling the county and KRC_
_to compensate the fishermen_
_for their loss of livelihood as a re-_
_sult of the aforesaid SGR project,”_
_said the judge._
_Justice Ogola has also issued a_

Politicians want levy
reviewed to lift the
burden from devolved
units at the coast


**BY ANTHONY KITIMO**

akitimo@ke.nationmedia.com


oast leaders want the government to review the Railway
〇〇〇

all the 47 counties to contribute to
the kitty to raise money to pay back
the debt without necessarily relying
on one region.
Led by Mombasa Governor Hassan
Joho, the leaders suggested that the
levy should be reviewed upwards from
the current 1.5 per cent to raise funds
within the shortest time possible to
clear the debt and free the Coast
region from the burden it is carrying
on behalf of the country.
“The national government argues
that the Port of Mombasa is a national
investment but it is only traders who
are subjected to the 1.5 per cent Railway Development Levy, which has
negatively affected business in Mombasa. That is why we are asking the
burden to be shared across all counties
since they directly or indirectly benefit
from the railway,” said Mr Joho.
Speaking during a meeting to validate an assessment report on the
socio-economic impact of operationalisation of the Standard Gauge Railway
(SGR), carried out by the University
of Nairobi, the leaders said the Coast
region has been made to carry the
burden of the country by stopping
cargo nominations and stopping cargo
transportation using trucks.
“Other regions are benefiting from
SGR infrastructure but Coast people
are experiencing losses as businesses
close in Mombasa. That is why we
are asking the national government
to have consultations with all leaders
on how best each stakeholder benefits
from the project,” said the Mombasa
governor.
The meeting was attended by many
leaders, among them Mombasa Sen


ator Mohammed Faki, MPs Omar
Mwinyi (Changamwe), Mishi Mboko
(Likoni) and Zulekha Hassan (Kwale
Woman Representative).
The politicians raised concerns over
the negative effects of SGR which have
led to thousands of people working in
Container Freight Stations (CFSs),
clearing departments and transport
sector losing their jobs.
“We want SGR to haul only 30 per
cent of the cargo while the remaining
to be transported by trucks so that
we can ensure our economy is not
derailed. We are alarmed by simple
indicators, such as increasing cases of
house rent defaulters due to increasing
number of people sacked from CFSs
and transport sector,” said Mr Joho.
A spot check by the _Nation_ showed
that a number of houses in Mombasa
westland side have been vacated as
many families that have been depending on the transport sector and
CFSs for a living opt to relocate to
different towns.
A number of clearing agents and
CFS owners have in the past one year
relocated to the Inland Container
Depot in Nairobi, where business is
now booming.
In the study, the UoN pointed out
that the government lost more than
Sh126 billion on revenue from Mombasa County since the introduction of
freight trains in the past one year as
more than 60 per cent of employees
working on Container Freight Stations
(CFSs) got sacked.
The report indicated that the
economic state of Mombasa is at
‘economic decay point’ with CFSs,
long distance truckers and transport
related businesses such as fuelling and
service stations being most affected.
A total of 2,987 employees working in CFSs, trucks and fuel stations
have been laid off in the past one
year, while more than 8,111 workers
are expected to be sent home if the
directive is upheld.
Mombasa could also fail to collect
more than Sh17.3 billion due to closure of various businesses, while fuel
stations, hotels and lodges along the
Northern Corridor will be affected.

_The county government_
_plans to increase the de-_
_volved unit’s tree cover to_
_201,255 hectares from the_
_current 8,348 hectares over_
_the next 10 years._
_In a plan that was_
_launched recently and_
_dubbed “The 2021-2030 For-_
_est Landscape Restoration_
_Strategy”, authorities paint_
_a worrying picture of for-_
_est degradation as farmers_
_clear trees to plant crops._
_Despite the county having_
_the highest tree cover at 27._
_5 per cent and forest cover_
_at 26.2 per cent, there’s need_
_put in more efforts to coun-_
_ter the destruction, officials_
_said. According to the doc-_
_ument, a total of 9,703 hec-_
_tares of forest have been_
_converted to farmland._
_Ndaragwa Constituency is_
_the most affected at 3,800_
_hectares._
_“Nyandarua is among the_
_leading counties in forest_
_and tree cover. The county_
_has an impressive 26.2 per_
_cent forest cover and a tree_
_cover of 27.5 per cent but_
_there is a need to protect_
_the gains by planting more_
_trees and reclaiming the for-_
_est land,” Chief Conservator_
_of Forests Julius Kamau said._
_Governor Francis Ki-_
_memia said the county_
_will promote the growth_
_of high-value trees such as_
_fruit trees._
_He said: “Planting and in-_
_vesting in the trees will max-_
_imise their value for agricul-_
_tural landscapes through_
_agroforestry. Forests have_
_been decimated by wildfires_
_started by honey harvesters_
_and charcoal burners._
_“There has been riverine_
_degradation caused by poor_
_agricultural practices as well_
_as greenhouse gases,” he_
_added._

_crease the volume of cargo fer-_
_ried to the hinterland through_
_the SGR freight service. Some_
_additional 500 wagons will be_
_bought to meet rising transport_
_demands, according to Kenya_
_Railways Corporation (KRC)._
_Mr Thomas Ojijo, KRC’s Coast_
_perations Manager, told Nation_
_the plans had been approved._
_KRC operates 10 freight trains_
_from Mombasa, nine to Nairobi_
_and one to Naivasha._
_Mr Ojijo said 1,620 wagons_
_that are currently in use are not_
_enough. He said rail transport is_
_energy and time-efficient, cost-ef-_
_fective, saves road maintenance_
_costs, and reduces safety expo-_
_sure on roads._
_Nairobi ICD manager Paul Bor_
_said linking of the SGR and me-_
_tre-gauge railway will increase_
_the trin’s cargo volumes._


**Regional logistics**
_Once SGR operations are fully in-_
_tegrated with the metre-gauge_
_railway and the Nairobi commut-_
_er train service, he said, passen-_
_ger and cargo numbers will in-_
_crease significantly, leading to a_
_drop in import costs and lower-_
_ing prices of goods and services._
_The Dongo Kundu Special Eco-_
_nomic Zone Authority will be es-_
_tablished in July as part of efforts_
_to turn Mombasa into a regional_
_logistics and manufacturing hub._
_The centre will comprise an ex-_
_port-processing zone, industrial_
_parks, free trade zones and oth-_
_er auxiliary services such as tour-_
_ism, meeting, conferencing and_
_exhibitions._
_It will also have zoned residen-_
_tial areas for workers._
_The zone is one of the compo-_
_nents of the Mombasa Port De-_
_velopment Project—a series of_
_projects that seek to expand the_
_capacity of the port and enhance_
_logistics along the Northern Eco-_
_nomic Corridor connecting land-_
_locked countries in Eastern Afri-_
_ca to the coast._

_A big problem, however, is that_
_in an attempt to help SGR gen-_

_west, including transit goods to_
_Uganda and other neighbouring_

_Mombasa politicians have long_

he widely circulated photo
showing uniformed Kenyans
〇〇〇

man inside the standard gauge railway
premises is not depicting a punishment
scene, but an exercise session, a senior
official said yesterday.
Mr Harrison Kinyanjui, an assistant
manager for passenger services at Madaraka Express, said the photographed
men were doing press-ups as part of a
drill at the Syokimau station.
“You cannot be told to lie down
and then you are caned. A father of
someone? And then men, 20-plus
men, people’s fathers, you lie down to
be caned? People with beards, how?
Don’t you think that is pure exaggeration?” he asked.
Every employee who handles train
operations, he added, has to undergo
drills for at least four months to ensure
they are fit for work.
“You cannot be train crew and yet
you’re not maintaining your body
shape,” Mr Kinyanjui said.
“You have to do these drills and
everything to ensure that if it is tidying
up the luggage rack, you are fit, your
body is not strained. It gives us an advantage to work softly and smoothly,”
he added.
He also admitted that smoking
among the Chinese staff in-charge of
railway operations is a problem Kenyans are dealing with because, “This
thing is their culture; it is not that they
intend to offend”.
“In the trains, they are now adapting into looking for other ways to
relax other than smoking. We could
be demanding a lot that may put the
culture away from them; but we are
harmonising,” said Mr Kinyanjui.
He is one of the individuals who
spoke with the _Sunday Nation_ yesterday as part of the China Road and
Bridge Corporation’s fightback against
media reports about unfair practises
against Kenyan staff.
Other Kenyans who discussed the
situation are Ms Mary Mwihaki, who
works in the human resources office
and Mr Robert Ng’eno, one of the
team leaders in the cargo transport
department.
Adding his voice in the rebuttal was
Mr Dai Yunjie, the deputy general
manager of the standard gauge railway
operations, who explained that the
concept of strict adherence to time is
one of the cultural differences between
Kenyans and the Chinese that are yet
to be aligned fully.
During the interviews, it emerged
that the recent media reports about a
difficult working environment had led
to a shake-up of various operations of
the Standard Gauge Railway (SGR).
Ms Mwihaki said that besides administrators holding meetings with staff,
management changes had been done.
“There have been changes in some
departments; like you’ll find some
departments where the managers or
supervisors were changed or reshuffled,” she said.

Jubilee and ODM leaders yesterday united
in their call to President Uhuru Kenyatta
and opposition leader Raila Odinga not to
be distracted by critics of the 'handshake' for
the sake of achieving peace and tranquility
in the country.
While lauding the two leaders for their
efforts to unite Kenyans, the leaders committed to support the Building Bridges
initiative to actualise the March 9 handshake. Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria
hailed Mr Odinga for the sacrifice he has
undertaken for the country and agreeing to
work with President Kenyatta.
""It could not have been possible for me
and others from Jubilee to come to Nyanza
and mingle with the residents like it has
happened had it not been for the handshake.
The divisions happened because of a silly
political divide,"" he said during a thanks
giving ceremony for ICT Principal Secretary
Jerome Ochieng' at Kajimbo in Nyakach
constituency, Kisumu County.
Mr Kuria pointed out that a lot of people
could not believe that Mr Kenyatta and Mr
Odinga could work together.
""I sought clarification from Mr Odinga
who assured me that the handshake was
not about politics of 2022 or awarding
positions but bringing Kenyans together,""
said Mr Kuria who committed to support
the initiative.
He however challenged the two leaders
to embrace all Kenyans and bring on board
〇〇〇


leaders from across the political divide to
achieve the objective of national unity.


**Political debt**


Kisumu Senator Fred Outa also termed
the new found working relationship be##### f f


tween Mr Kenyatta and Mr Odinga as
unprecedented.
""In the eleventh Parliament, Mr Kuria
and I were like oil and water. What the duo
did was beyond our imagination,"" he said.
He however called on President Kenyatta
to support Mr Odinga's presidential bid in
2022 as a fulfillment of political debt between the first President Jomo Kenyatta and
his deputy Jaramogi Oginga as well as the
one between the ODM leader and former
President Mwai Kibaki.
Similar sentiments were echoed by Uriri
MP Mark Nyamita and his Nyakach counterpart Aduma Owuor who hosted the event.
But Marakwet West MP William Kisang
who is an ally of Mr Ruto called on Mr
Odinga to reciprocate the overwhelming
support he received from the Kalenjin
community in 2007 when he joined forces
with Mr Ruto in ODM.
Mr Nyamita while accusing Mr Ruto's
supporters of dragging Mr Odinga’s name
in every issue, said that Mr Ruto should
not expect to be handed leadership on a
silver platter.
“They know very well that Mr Odinga
has no powers to evict the people living in
Mau Forest but they keep accusing him of
the same,” he said.
Kiambu Woman Rep Gathoni wa
Muchomba and her Dagoretti South counterpart Jon Kiarie also expressed optimism
that the handshake will bear fruits for the
sake of all Kenyans.
In the spirit of handshake, Kisumu Deputy
Governor Mathews Owili said President
Kenyatta is expected to launch universal
health coverage in the lakeside town early
next month.
“The two leaders should work together
and fight corruption which threatens to
deny Kenyans access to essential services,”
he said.


〇〇〇


〇〇〇

Mr Dai added that the corporation
had singled out 22 “detailed measures”
that it will take, adding that they had
been submitted to the Kenya Railways
Corporation.
“The company is planning to carry
out activities themed on integration
of Kenyan and Chinese employees,”
he said.
Today, Madaraka Express staff and
their Chinese bosses will have a retreat
at Ngong Hills, in a trip Mr Kinyanjui
said was an outing “just to ensure that
we get to understand each other”.


〇〇〇

“Both sides have to bend. We have to
bend on our part and they have to bend
so that we can harmonise,” he said.
In recent media reports, some of the
shocking practices exposed included
the underworking of Kenyan staff,
where highly qualified personnel have
been assigned minor roles.
The Kenyan staff who spoke with the
_Sunday Nation_ said the disgruntlement
may have come out of the fact that at
the time when Kenyans are hired by
SGR, they are considered to be in one
level, because they are given jobs after
qualifying from the Railway Training
Institute.
“When you are joining us, we are
not looking at what you came with. We
take what you came with from Railway
Training Institute,” said Ms Mwihaki.
“Nobody had done it as a degree.
There is no railway training here in
Kenya, so everybody began equal. As
we progressed, the company has its
own system of promotion, whereby
they check your performance,” added
Mr Kinjanjui. Mr Dai said the disgruntlement among some staff has made
the train operator to consider a way
of promoting Kenyans.


**Management level**


“In the future, the company is planning to gradually promote Kenyan
employees from more professions to
high or middle-level management and
core positions,” he said.
“The railway operation has strict
requirements on the technical business
ability and safety awareness of the
technical employees. According to the
requirements and qualifications, the
key positions must be trained in the
training period of one to three years,”
he added.
Kenyans working with the SGR had
also complained of operational difficulties because there were notices and
operational items written in Chinese.
Mr Dai admitted that not all material
had been translated.
“The translation from Chinese to
English is being continuously carried
out since the inauguration of the
railway. Because of the quantity and
difficulty of translating professional

Express Station

documents, it still needs a while to
finish all the translation,” he said.
“The company is planning to invest
more manpower and time on the translation and finish it at the end of 2018.”
Complaints about non-issuance of
payslips were also listed by Kenyan
staff, and Ms Mwihaki said changes
are being done to shift from manual
issuance of payslips.
“The company will implement a
payroll system to allow staff access
their payslips on email from wherever
they are,” she said.
The report about mistreatment of
Kenyan staff had drawn widespread
fury, with National Assembly summoning, among others, Kenya Railways
Managing Director Atanas Maina and
Transport Cabinet Secretary James
Macharia to shed light on the matter.
Mr Macharia, while appearing before
the assembly’s committee on Transport
on Tuesday, painted a rosy picture
of the operations, and he admitted
that it is only until 2027 that Chinese
workers will leave. The staff who spoke
yesterday did not paint a very rosy
picture, admitting that they could do
with a little ironing of teething issues.
“We have a few challenges here and
there but, as a department, we are
trying our best. Because this railway
is a new thing altogether, we have the
Chinese with the knowledge and skills
they have to transfer to us,” said Mr
Ng’eno, the team leader in the cargo
department. He added that to fight
the language barrier, officials like him
use the WeChat app that instantly
translates messages.
They were, however, categorical
that no one has ever been punished
by flogging, saying there was a detailed disciplinary mechanism listed
in staff contracts. Mr Dai expounded
on the “cultural differences” cited in a
newspaper advertisement on Wednesday as one of the reasons behind the
misunderstanding.
“For Chinese staff, it has become a
habit to use their spare time to beautify the environment of the station.
However, due to Sino-Africa cultures
differences, local staff think that this
is something outside the scope of
work,” he said.

layers in the transport and
tourism sectors have wel## P comed the start of Kwa

Jomvu-Makupa causeway expansion
that will ease traffic at Kibarani along
the Mombasa-Nairobi highway.
The 11.3km road will boost tourism, ease movement of people and
goods and improve efficiency at the
port of Mombasa.
Kenya National Highways
Authority (KeNHA) corporate
communications assistant director
Charles Njogu said on Wednesday
that the current narrow road handles
19,000 vehicles daily moving in and
out of Mombasa, resulting in huge
traffic snarl-ups.
“The new road will have six lanes
— three lanes on both sides — and
once completed, it will decongest
the town. It will also increase the
traffic count, and perhaps doubling
it,” he said.
Mr Njogu said the road, whose
construction has already started at
Kibarani, will have a service lane on
each side and several interchanges
along its major traffic exchange
points.


**Narrow**
The old and ageing road has been
a nightmare to motorists because it
is narrow and can no longer handle
the increasing traffic in Mombasa
and its environs.
“We have discovered that traffic snarl-ups always build up at
Changamwe before extending to
other sides of the highway. In this
particular place, we shall set up a
double-decker interchange to address the problem.
“There will be several exit routes
to end the traffic menace in that
area,” Mr Njogu said.
The road starts at the junction
of Kenyatta Avenue and Digo Road
running northerly through Changamwe, Miritini and Mazeras before
terminating shortly after Mariakani
weighbridge.
The Makupa Causeway is crucial
as it connects the Kenya Ports Authority, Moi International Airport
and Standard Gauge Railway Miritini
terminus among other industries at
the mainland.
It is part of the Sh6.5 billion
expansion project of the Mom

the start of the expansion works this week.



basa-Jomvu road to a six-lane
superhighway launched by President
Uhuru Kenyatta last year.
The works along the highway
comprise the strengthening of the
existing bituminous road and widening the road to three lanes dual
carriageway with service roads,
footpaths and street lighting.
The upgrade also includes construction of new structures, replacing



existing structures with new ones
and provision of new interchanges
at various locations along the road
to avoid traffic conflict between the
main carriageway and cross roads.
Motorists and commuters, who
have been spending hours in the
traffic jam, said their nightmares
will end once the road is completed.
In an interview yesterday, Kenya
International Freight and Warehousing Association (Kifwa) national
chairman William Ojonyo said the
construction of the road is good.
But he said the timing of the project is wrong since the cargo volume
transported by road from the port
of Mombasa has reduced by 40 per
cent. Most cargo from the port, he
noted, is now being carried through
the Standard Gauge Railway (SGR)
cargo trains.
“It is a good initiative but at the
moment, the cargo volume transported by road is low as most goods
are ferried by SGR cargo trains. The
government can as well initiate such
a road at the ICD [Inland Container
Depot] Nairobi, where most cargo
is destined to nowadays,” he said.
Car Importers Association of
Kenya chairman Peter Otieno hailed
the expansion of the road, saying the
association advocated for the same
way back in 2006.
“This has been our dream for
many years. We started talking



and pushing the government long
ago to act on the road, which is the
backbone of our economy,” he said.
Mr Otieno said car importers use
the road often after clearing their
vehicles at the Mombasa port but
it has been a huge challenge.
“The expansion of the road will
mean more vehicles using the road
without encountering any traffic
jam, and that will also speed up the
movement of cargo and other commodities from the port of Mombasa,”
Mr Otieno said.


**Traffic jams**
Kenya Transporters Association
operations co-ordinator Mercy Ireri
told the Nation the construction is
welcome since it will speed up the
transportation of cargo from the port
city to other destinations.
“We are affected by traffic jams
at Kibarani which has led to several
challenges in terms of transporting
cargo. The road is narrow and can
no longer cope with the increasing
number of trucks, matatus and
private vehicles plying the highway.
Hopefully, the expansion will end
this problem,” Ms Ireri said.
Commuters using the road have
termed the construction a milestone
in ending the nightmares they encounter daily.
“I live in Mariakani, I have been
travelling to Kongowea market



daily to fetch fresh farm produce
like tomatoes, kales, cabbages and
onions. Traffic jam has been my
biggest nightmare. This new road
will now boost my business,” Ms
Charinza Pendo said.
Tourism sector players, led by the
Kenya Association of Hotelkeepers
and Caterers Coast branch executive officer Sam Ikwaye, hailed the
project, saying Mombasa has had
serious infrastructural challenges
which has affected business operations.
“The tourism sector has particularly been hit because we depend
on the movement of motorists. But
the road will boost the sector,” Mr
Ikwaye said.


**Challenging**
“The road will raise Mombasa
into a conference destination which
is significant to the development
of tourism. It will also improve efficiency at the port which has been
challenging due to lack of external
infrastructure outside the facility,”
Mr Ikwaye said.
Trucks have been leaving the
port and causing congestion at the
Mombasa-Nairobi highway.
“But the completion of the road
will make the port more efficient. We
have lost a lot of business because
people are afraid to be stuck in jams
at Kibarani and Likoni ferry,” Mr
Ikwaye added.
But with the construction of the
Dongo Kundu road and the Mombasa-Kwa Jomvu section of the Nairobi
-Mombasa road, Mr Ikwaye said
Kenya is looking at growing business
in the region.
Plaza Beach Hotel sales and
marketing manager Daniel Ogechi
said at times both international and
local tourists cancel their bookings
in hotels within north coast after
spending hours in traffic jams at
Kibarani and Nyali bridge.
“They would rather spend their
holidays in hotels within the CBD.
But the road will boost our business
because there will be no traffic jams
and our tourists will not be caught
up in the gridlock. A tourist can
spend an hour at Kibarani due to
traffic jam,” he said.
“The Mombasa-Kwa Jomvu
section under financing by the
government and the African Development Bank is the first phase
of the longer Mombasa-Mariakani
corridor earmarked for expansion,”
KeNHA said in a statement
Financing for Phase 2 — Jomvu
— Mariakani section — will be revealed at a later date. “This road is
very strategic and is approximately
41km and forms part of the 500km
Mombasa-Nairobi highway that also
constitutes part of the Northern
Corridor linking the Kenyan Coast
with the neighbouring countries of
Uganda, Sudan and Rwanda,” Mr
Njogu added.

The trial of former Nairobi Governor
Evans Kidero and six other officials faced
a hitch yesterday after it emerged that
the prosecution was yet to supply all the
statements to the defence team.
Appearing before senior principal
magistrate Lawrence Mugambi, defence
lawyers — led by Senior Counsel Tom
Ojienda — informed the court that they
were yet to be supplied with witness
statements and other documents the
prosecution will rely on during the trial.



Dr Kidero is said to have received
a total of Sh24 million from Lodwar
Wholesalers Ltd, on diverse dates.
The pre-trial of the case will be held
on September 6.
Meanwhile, the court heard that Ms
Grace Wakhungu, who is charged with
fraud together with Sirisia MP John
Waluke, is yet to be arrested.
Mr Waluke denied the charges but
Ms Wakhungu is yet to be arraigned in
court. They are accused defrauding the
National Cereals and Produce Board. The
case will be mentioned on September 25.



Mr Mugambi directed the prosecution
to supply the documents and appear
before him on August 29, to confirm
the same.
Dr Kidero (left), together with former
chief officers in his administration, have
denied graft and abuse of office charges
and are out on bond.
They include former county secretary
Lilian Ndegwa, former chief finance
officer Jimmy Mutuku Kiamba, former

_It is clear the Naivasha extension_

_The extension to Naivasha after_

_When the Chinese financiers_

_dead._
_The SGR ended at a desolate sta-_
_tion “in the middle of nowhere”,_
_but the government insisted on_
_turning the railhead into a dry_
_port._
_The idea was that goods destined_
_for western Kenya and across the_

_The transformation is visible,_
_with heightened activities at the_
_station, including the completion_
_of the MGR and SGR link._
_Workers go through their drills_
_with precision as the ICD near Sus-_
_wa – but often called Naivasha ICD_
_– takes shape._
_The initial aim of extending the_
_120-kilometre line was to link spe-_
_cial industrial zones in Naivasha_
_– the home of OlKaria geother-_
_mal power plants – to Nairobi and_
_Mombasa._
_To attract investors to planned_
_industrial complexes at the spe-_
_cially designated zones near Ol Ka-_
_ria, the government offered subsi-_
_dised power._
_The tentative plan included_
_firms having electricity connected_
_directly from Olkaria to ensure un-_
_interrupted supplies, and in some_
_cases, companies such as those_
_dealing in apparel, allowed access_
_to steam._


**Kisumu and Malaba**

_In Naivasha, however, the expect-_
_ed trickle-down effect – especial-_
_ly among traders near the ICD – is_
_yet to be felt as epitomised by ki-_
_osk owner Beatrice Kerubo._
_“Business has been slow, espe-_
_cially since the repair of the MGR._
_The number of trucks has drasti-_
_cally reduced,” she said._
_Previously, she said, traders near_
_the dry port used to make a killing._
_“Many trucks used to arrive at_
_the ICD for cargo. Unfortunate-_
_ly, things have changed. It is no_
_longer the same story,” Ms Kerubo_
_said._
_Many traders near the ICD have_
_shifted to other areas. Ms Keru-_
_bo says she is on the verge of giv-_
_ing up._
_With the old railwayline rehabil-_
_itated by the Kenya Defence Forc-_
_es and the new metre gauge line_
_connected to the SGR station, Ken-_
_ya Railways in January successful-_
_ly ran the first trial freight._



_with programmes that benefit a_
_few to the detriment of the Coast,”_
_he said._
_“We will take administrative and_
_legal steps to reverse what has be-_
_come the biggest impoverishment_
_of the region.”_
_He has also alluded to claims_
_that Naivasha SGR station and the_
_ICD are on land belonging to Presi-_
_dent Uhuru Kenyatta’s family._
_Cutting across landmarks, in-_
_cluding Ngong Hills, Nairobi Na-_
_tional Park and the Great Rift Val-_
_ley, the meandering SGR line has_
_put the desolate and semi-arid_
_Maai Mahiu on the global map._
_Just years ago, the town that de-_
_rives its name from nearby hot_
_springs, looked like a veritable_
_wasteland, with acres covered by_
_swathes of acacia._
_Families with huge tracts of land_
_in the area had no or little interest_
_in developing them._
_The railway station gives com-_
_muters a chance to enjoy the mar-_
_vels of mother nature, including_
_gazelles grazing in the grasslands._



_then transferred to the old metre_
_gauge railway (MGR)._
_Land was even set aside where_
_Uganda, Rwanda and other transit_
_destinations could build their con-_
_tainer yards._
_But there was a problem. By the_
_time the train service was being_
_launched, there was little in the_
_way of a good all-weather road to_
_the station or Naivasha._
_There was no rail link between_
_the station where the SGR line ter-_
_minated and the old MGR station_
_in Naivasha._
_The old railway, built more than_
_a century ago, was dilapidated and_
_in need of restoration. It was not_
_in a good condition for passenger_
_and cargo trains._
_When the idea of building a rail-_
_way line was mooted, speculators_
_rubbed their hands in glee, antic-_
_ipating a windfall from the mega_
_projects._
_The railway was expected to_
_shore up economic activities in_
_Maai Mahiu, Suswa and other are-_
_as near the line. Prices of land shot_
_up tenfold._
_“The projects are a masterstroke._
_We will have a complete picture_
_of Maai Mahiu in years to come._
_Landowners have been smiling_
_all the way to the bank,” former_
_Chamber of Commerce boss Njug-_
_una Kamau said._
_Now, the SGR and the Naivasha_
_ICD are in the news once more,_
_with Deputy President William_
_Ruto vowing to undo the projects_
_if elected._
_Giving in to the demands of_
_Coast leaders, Dr Ruto has pledged_
_to put the Nairobi and Naivasha_
_ICDs out of business and return_
_operations to Mombasa._
_“It was never the intention of_
_the government to build the SGR_
_and impoverish the Coast. It was_
_meant to make the port more effi-_
_cient, better and improve fortunes_
_of Coast people. Unfortunately,_

To keep operations afloat, the rail operator is in a frenzy to woo companies to continue transporting goods on the SGR even
after President Ruto vacated an August 2018 order that made it compulsory to move cargo via the Mombasa-Nairobi line

_cargo haulage on the Standard Gauge_
_Railway (SGR) to and from the Mom-_
_basa port, it is no longer business as_
_usual for KRC with its management_
_now thrust into a race for survival._
_Keen on keeping the SGR operations_
_afloat, KRC is in a frenzy to woo compa-_
_nies to haul cargo on the SGR even af-_
_ter President William Ruto vacated an_
_August 2018 order that made it com-_
_pulsory to ferry goods via the line._
_Mr Mainga has in the past two_
_weeks met the managers of several_
_giant logistics companies including_
_PIL, WEC Lines (K) Ltd, Mediterrane-_
_an Shipping Company (MSC), Acceler_
_Global Logistics Company, and Muran-_
_ga Freight Forwarders._
_“The two organisations agreed to_
_continue working together to elimi-_
_nate hurdles and use both SGR and_
_MGR for cargo movement from Mom-_
_basa to Nairobi and Nairobi to Mom-_
_basa, to enhance the safe, secure and_
_convenient movement of bulk haul-_
_age,” KRC said in a Twitter release fol-_
_lowing a meeting between Mr Mainga_
_and the management of Acceler Glob-_
_al Logistics Company on October 5._
_Smart Business was unable to get Mr_
_Mainga’s comments on the KRC’s push_
_to retain deals for cargo haulage._
_The order compelling importers to_
_use the SGR was meant to guarantee_
_the viability of the rail investment._
_Without the flow of cargo, the govern-_
_ment and the Chinese operator will_
_find it extremely difficult to repay the_
_loan and keep the railway operational_
_especially since the line has been loss-_
_making despite the cargo business as-_

_surance._
_SGR, which was retired President_
_Uhuru Kenyatta’s pet project, is re-_
_sponsible for a huge jump in Kenya’s_
_debt that will now have to be met by_
_taxpayers alone._
_The government on-lent loans to_
_State corporations have increased 124_
_percent to Sh882 billion mainly due_
_to KRC for the implementation of the_
_standard gauge rail._
_According to a World Bank review_
_of Kenyan corporations, the KRC has_
_received Sh539.2 billion but has a net_
_worth of a mere Sh634 million._
_It was making a loss of Sh24.1 billion_
_annually even with the State order for_
_compulsory use of the line by local im-_
_porters._
_Cargo and passenger revenues from_
_the SGR rose 7.8 percent to Sh7.1 bil-_
_lion in the six months to June, extend-_
_ing recovery from the global Covid-19_



_onward clearance, saying it had raised_
_the cost of doing business, with the_
_costs passed on to consumers._
_Kenya Transport Association chair-_
_man Newton Wang’oo said SGR_
_should compete with roads on an_
_equal opportunity basis, which will_
_ultimately lower the cost of transport_
_and improve services._
_Investors at Container Freight Sta-_
_tion complained that investments_
_worth more than Sh60 billion risk_
_going down the drain if the govern-_
_ment’s directive to transfer all import-_
_ed cargo to Inland Container Depot_
_(ICD) through the SGR continues._
_Kenya Transporters Association also_
_argued that the SGR move will make_
_more than 15,000 people, who were_
_working as drivers, and 15,000 turn-_
_boys jobless._
_“One train transports about 107 con-_
_tainers…this means 107 trucks are_
_automatically off the road and at the_
_same time in just one day, 107 drivers_
_are out of the job without income,”_
_said KTA chief operations officer Mer-_
_cy Ireri then._
_KTDA Holdings, which resisted the_
_push to ferry tea via the rail, said using_
_SGR would cost twice as much due to_
_the logistical nightmares._
_It would cost them Sh1.8 billion to_
_transport 322 million tonnes of tea_
_to Mombasa on the SGR compared to_
_Sh940 million by road._
_The rate of transporting the cargo_
_per kilometre would rise from Sh4.2_
_to Sh8.2 on the cost of moving emp-_
_ty containers by road from the ICD_



_in Nairobi to respective factories and_
_back after loading._
_Other costs included wharfage, han-_
_dling, and freight charges, offloading_
_and reloading at ICDN and the last_
_mile to the warehouse, security car-_
_go insurance cover and delivery time-_
_frames, logistical reliability of food-_
_grade containers, and the lengthy pa-_
_perwork._
_“KTDA and KRC team agreed that_
_on the attainment of SGR rate to the_
_envisaged matching of current road_
_rate of Sh4.23 from the current railage_
_rate of Sh8.27, initial trial runs will be_
_expedited from Nairobi and being_
_successful will be rolled out progres-_
_sively to other stations,” partly reads_
_a joint June 2021 declaration signed_
_by KRC chairman James Siele and Si-_
_mon Gikanga, the general manager of_
_freight services at KTDA’s Chai Trad-_
_ing Company._
_But to attain this efficiency, the cash-_
_strapped loss-making railway would_
_require immense investment to meet_
_company needs._
_KTDA for instance was asking for_
_dedicated pick-up points outside ICDN_
_where land value has risen, making it_
_hard to secure space._
_KTDA demanded a special rate of_
_Sh4.2 per ton per kilometre which_
_would mean the railway carries the ex-_
_tra costs._
_They also wanted KRC to come up_
_with modalities of door-to-door deliv-_
_ery that would include a multimodal_
_system of transport from factories to_
_warehouses._



“KRC’s poor performance
was largely driven by
rising expenses between
the financial year 2018/19
and 2019/20, outpacing
revenues which, despite
the pandemic, increased
by 38 percent. KRC’s
losses of Sh24.1 billion are
responsible for 57 percent
of total commercial State

_MPs feel the private companies that are_

_Dockworkers Union fear that private_

_The union prefers the government_

_Other shipping lines can be brought on_

_changed the stakes._
_Parliament now seeks to quash Presi-_

_to transfer port, rail and pipeline corpo-_
_rations to the National Treasury arguing_
_that stakeholders were not involved._
_Funyula MP Ojiambo Oundo asked_
_members to launch an inquiry into_
_how Kenya Transport and Logistics Net-_
_work (KTLN) was formed and whether_
_due process for moving public port, rail-_
_way and pipeline corporations and their_
_budgets to Treasury was followed._
_“What is the legal status of the estab-_
_lishment of KTLN? What is the organi-_
_sational structure of this new entity vis_
_a vis the existing structures for the KRC,_
_KPC, KPA and the ICDC?” Mr Oundo_
_asked the Finance Committee._
_MPs also want to know whether stake-_
_holders such as the Kenya ports workers_
_union were consulted when the transfer_
_was made and how private players have_
_been allowed to operate in the local fa-_
_cilities._
_Last year President Kenyatta moved_
_the Kenya Ports Authority (KPA), Kenya_
_Railways Corporation (KRC) and Kenya_
_Pipeline Company Limited (KPC) to the_



_Industrial and Commercial Develop-_
_ment Corporation (ICDC) under Treas-_
_ury through an executive order._
_KPA makes Sh48 billion annually, KPC_
_revenues are Sh31.4 billion and KRC is_
_in the red and has racked up a combined_
_operating loss of Sh21.68 billion in the_
_three years to May 2020._
_When President Kenyatta combined_
_them under one balance sheet, analysts_
_read into the real motive which was to_
_create an entity that will fulfil conces-_
_sions with the Chinese to pay the KRC_
_costs and supply KPC container numbers_
_used to guarantee the standard gauge_
_railway loans._
_“Creating a holding company with_
_a big balance sheet was seen as a way_
_of guaranteeing the Chinese loans,” a_
_source told Smart Business on condition_
_of anonymity._
_But the move has stirred the hornets_
_nest with local interest from private_
_players and politically connected busi-_

_First MPs shaved off Sh9.6 billion from_
_Treasury’s budget meant for the infra-_
_structure projects saying Finance Cabi-_
_net Secretary Ukur Yatani will find it dif-_
_ficult to balance between implementing_
_projects and financing them._
_Treasury cuts have targeted gener-_
_al planning and support to the tune of_
_Sh6 billion, public financial manage-_
_ment (Sh4.9 billion) and Lapsset (Sh600_
_million). “While the committee appre-_

_ministries, there is concern that the ma-_
_jor problem is the flow of exchequer on_
_a timely basis,” Kanini Kega led Budget_

material to make her behinds
look big did not augur well with
some viewers.
“Blackface” — the using of
make-up to lampoon black people
is largely considered offensive and
has deep racist roots in America
and Europe. Those critical of the
show shared their views with mainstream and social media outlets.
“Whatever the intention, it’s not
acceptable,” Ms Lina Benabdallah,
an Africa specialist at Wake Forest
University in North Carolina, told
the _New York Times._
“ _CCTV’s_ racist show during
Spring Gala shook me and made
me so ashamed of China and my
people,” stated one Twitter user.
“It was cringe-worthy at best,
completely racist at worst. It’s Africa, so bring out tribal dancers and
animals? And was that a Chinese
woman in black face with a fake
posterior?” tweeted another.
The _Sunday Nation_ contacted the
Foreign Affairs ministry for Kenya’s
response on the matter but none
was forthcoming.
“Let it wait probably till Monday,”
the ministry’s communications facilitator Edwin Limo said.
A communications officer at
the Chinese Embassy had not
responded to our message by the
time of going to press.
The skit’s plot was simple: have
a Chinese man to act as if he is
somewhere in Kenya with a Kenyan
woman. The woman has convinced
the Chinese man to pretend to be
her boyfriend because she does not
want to meet a man her mother
wants her to date.
The mother soon comes and
the Chinese man and the Kenyan
woman act as if they are in a relationship until the Chinese girlfriend
shows up.
The mother, rather than being
furious that her daughter is being
taken for a ride by this Chinese
man, declares that she cannot



lose her cool “because China has
doneso much for Africa” according
to a whatsonweibo.com report on
the performance.
“I love Chinese people! I love
China!” she says.
The problem arose mostly from
the actress who played the role of
a mother of a Kenyan woman in
the show that started on Thursday
at 8pm Beijing time (3pm Nairobi
time).
She was a famous Chinese
actress called Lou Naiming. She
had used black makeup to make
herself look like an African and
had fixed fake behinds. She entered
the stage carrying a basketful of
fruits and walking in an exaggerated manner.

racism controversy brewed over a
skit aired by China’s State broadcaster on Thursday.
The presentation, broadcasted on
_China Central Television (CCTV)_
for the Chinese audience as part
of a four-hour show to celebrate
China’s Lunar New Year, had a
scene about Kenya’s Standard
Gauge Railway (SGR) that some
observers found racist.
It was meant to make people
laugh and, in the process, fit into
the theme of China’s strengthening relationship with Africa. That
was the theme CCTV had chosen
for this year’s Spring Festival Gala
— an event viewed on TV by an
estimated 700 million people every
year, making it the most watched
entertainment programme in the
world.
However, the presence of a black

The Chinese who watched the

“Is it really hard to find an African actor? I’ve never been more
embarrassed in my life as a Chinese

Another posted: “How narcissistic must they be to think it was
a good idea to have an actor in

But not everyone thought the
depiction is stereotypical, if comments on the BBC World Facebook
are anything to go by.
“What is acceptable to laugh at

curvy woman is considered rude?”

“That is what humans have done

For a show to be beamed on
_CCTV, NYT_ reported, it has to be
rehearsed many times before senior

The theme of _CCTV’s_ show,
which was focusing on the good
relations between China and African states and its “One Belt, One

part of the Asian country’s cultural
diplomacy move to depict itself as
a friend of African nations.

petitive bidding, the contracts
show the deals were entered with
CRBC and China Exim Bank.
What was a grand dream that
would have connected Mombasa
to Kampala is a railway to nowhere that ends in a bush near a
cattle market that is inaccessible
when it rains.
The death of this dream, it
appears, began on June 25, 2012
when a team of nine negotiators
— fi ve from Kenya and four from
CRBC — sat to discuss the components of a feasibility study on
the viability of the SGR.
On the Kenyan side were Mr
Solomon Ouna, and Mr David
Mwadali, both engineers, Mr
Alfred Matheka, Ms Maryanne
Kitany and Mr Stanley Gitari.
“The Government of Kenya
and CRBC signed a memorandum of understanding on August
12, 2009 for the feasibility study
and preliminary design of the
Mombasa-Nairobi section of the
Standard Gauge Railway which
has been completed to the satisfaction of the Kenya technical
team,” say minutes from the
meeting.
“CRBC and Kenya Railways
now need to enter into a common
contract,” add the minutes.
And like vultures waiting on
the sidelines for pieces of meat
to drop out of a plate, the fi rst
commercial contract for civil
works was signed in a record
15 days after the results of the
feasibility study were adopted
on July 11, 2012.
I d e a l l y, s u c h a h u g e
contract, despite being a government-to-government deal as
the State has always maintained,
requires time for naming negotiating teams, a board meeting by
the concerned authority, followed
by seeking and getting approvals
from the ministry concerned and
the Attorney-General.
This is even before you factor
the time needed to draft a bill of
quantities for the construction at
hand plus the time needed for
technical teams from both sides
and lawyers to draft and look at
the details in the contracts before
they are presented for signing.
So were the necessary procedures followed as required by law
in such a short time? What we
now know is that in total, Kenya
signed four contracts for the
fi rst phase of the SGR — two of
them during the grand coalition
government and the last two immediately after Jubilee took offi ce.
The fi rst one with CRBC for
civil works was signed on July
11, 2012. The second one for the
supply of locomotives and rolling
stock was also signed with CRBC
a month later on August 29, 2012.
The third one for fi nancing the
project was signed with China
Exim Bank on May 11, 2014.
And when they were done
with the building of the railway,
imported the locomotives and
rolling stock, the next avenue of
making money was the operation
contract.
This contract was also handed
to CRBC, which would later hand
it over to its other subsidiary —
Africa Star Railway Operation
Company Limited — to carry
out the day-to-day running of
the train service.





alone following the withdrawal of
Uganda from the project.
The fi rst Sh25 billion of the
Sh324 billion borrowed from
China for phase one of the railway was due last month. Another
Sh25 billion will fall due in June.
Treasury has set aside Sh35 billion in the supplementary budget
to take care of the repayment to
China’s Exim Bank.
Retired President Mwai Kibaki
met Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni on October 28, 2008,
regarding the SGR. It was mutually agreed that the railway
line would be a white elephant
if Kenya decided to go it alone.
This position changed after
brokers introduced CRBC to the
Kenyan government in 2009. In
2008, two Kenyans — Leonard
Mwangi Ndungu and Peter
Maingi Gatere — had registered
a company with a similar name,
China Road and Bridge Corporation Kenya, with registration
number C 166624. When this
became public, the Registrar
of Companies was ordered to
deregister the company.
And while the Kenyan government has always maintained
that the SGR was a government-to-government contract,
hence there was no need for com










not meet the operation costs,
estimated at Sh1.5 billion a month
against average sales of only
Sh841 million.
Whereas the offi cial cost of
the project was put at Sh327
billion, the open-ended nature
of these contracts allowed some
variations in the bill of quantities
and if these were allowed, then
Kenya may have spent a little bit
more than that.
Interestingly, while the ‘Supply
and Installations of Facilities,
Locomotives and Rolling Stock’
contract was done in US dollars,
the ‘Civil Works’ contract was
done in Kenya shillings. Additionally, the portion of repayment for
the civil works contract, which
is worth Sh220,921,502,221.08,
is supposed to be paid back in
US dollars.
The ‘Supply and Installations of Facilities, Locomotives
and Rolling Stock’ contract,
which was signed in US dollars
amounts to $1,146,791,008.75
(Sh114.6 billion). When you
add up the two contracts, you
get $3,356,006,030.21 (Sh335
billion).
This cost does not reflect
the interest on the loan, the
20 per cent depreciation of the
currency and the Sh11.7 billion



companies have earned billions
of shillings in Kenya tax-free like
the SGR contractor.
The fact that the money moved
directly from China Exim Bank
to CRBC accounts denied the
country any benefi ts that would
have trickled in on account of
local purchases.
“The buyer (Kenya) shall pay
those amounts due to the seller
(CRBC) which are fi nanced by
the fi nancial institutions of China
to the seller (CRBC) through the
fi nancial institutions of China,”
the contract says.
In essence, this meant that
there was no trickle down eff ect
of this huge loan of the project
on the local economy as the Chinese imported almost everything
for the project, including small
things like toilet paper, toothpicks and sugar.
But even worse is the fact
that CRBC was given a leeway
to adjust the prices of individual
components of the contract by
making the bill of quantities
non-binding.
“The contract price is to be
adjusted for rises or falls in the
cost of labour, goods and other
inputs to the works by the addition or deduction of amounts,”



yans have been waiting for
President Kenyatta to make
public the contents of the SGR
contracts signed between the
government and the Chinese
financiers and contractors as
promised in December 2018.
And, while the President is yet
to honour his promise, which
would have put to rest speculations that Kenyans got the short
end of the stick on the fi nancing
and building of the SGR, the
government has been trying to
review the contract behind the

scenes.
It is understood that after President Kenyatta made the promise
to make public the contract, the
offi ce of the Attorney-General
and the Transport ministry
explained to State House the
implication of such a ‘breach of
contract’ given that it explicitly
said the contract would not be
made public.
Just why such a big contract
that would burden taxpayers for
decades to come became a secret
document is puzzling.
The _Nation_ reported last
month how the team tasked
with reviewing the skewed contract had hit a dead end. This is
after CRBC refused to provide



key information protected by
the confidentiality clauses in
the contract.
The team comprised offi cials
from the Presidential Delivery
Unit, the Office of the Attorney-General, Kenya Railways,
Ministry of Transport, the National Treasury and CRBC. It was
led by then Transport Principal
Secretary Esther Koimett.
“Publicity and disclosure of
any kind hereto to any third
party not involved in the present
contract requires the written approval of the other party. Such an
approval shall be required after
the performance of the present
contract,” says a clause in the
contract.
Government spending is
guided by, among several statutes, the Access to Information
Act, which is supposed to
enhance accountability, transparency, and public participation."

Prof Margaret Kobia, the Cabinet
secretary in the Ministry of Public Service, Youth and Gender Affairs, said the
government is committed to ensuring
that more jobs are created to secure
the future of the youth and the nation.
“You can still do a vocational training
after concluding your degree if that will
guarantee you a job,” Prof Kobia (below)
told over 300 youth who attended the
launch of the One Million Youth Empowerment Challenge programme at the
University of Nairobi Towers yesterday.
The programme, started by I Choose
Life (ICL)-Africa, aims to empower a
million youth by 2021 on several aspects including reproductive health,
innovation, sports, talent nurturing,
links to employment and leadership
and governance.


**Empowering youth**
The event attracted the hosts University of Bomet, Machakos University,
Olessos Technical Institute, Jaramogi
Oginga Odinga University of Science
and Technology, Laikipia University
and Technical University of Mombasa.
Prof Kobia, who was accompanied by
Sports Cabinet Secretary Amina Mohamed, said the government was only
able to create 850,000 new jobs and not
a million as had been promised in the
Jubilee manifesto. Of those created, 85
percent were in the informal sectors.
CS Mohamed urged youth to change
the notorious term of “peer pressure”
into “peer support”.
“Support each other to do the right
thing,” she said.
Mr Mike Mutungi, the chief executive officer of ICL, said empowering
the youth, who are the majority of the
Kenyan population, will contribute
greatly to attaining sustainable development goals.



Ministry now opts for
Naivasha-Malaba track,
which will cost Sh15bn
to restore and revamp

a glimmer of hope that the old metre-gauge railway would be repaired to
serve the region has fizzled out.
The government will not revive the
Nakuru-Kisumu railway line, presenting
a double blow to the lakeside city after
the SGR project stopped in Naivasha.
Transport and Infrastructure Cabinet
Secretary James Macharia yesterday
said the government had opted to revamp the Naivasha-Malaba line instead
at a cost of Sh15 billion as the Kisumu
line was “badly damaged”.
“The reality is that the Nakuru-Kisumu line is not in good shape; it has
17 bridges, which have been vandalised,
so it may require doing a new line altogether,” he said.
“We will have to weigh that against
the fact that in future, we still have to
do the SGR to Kisumu. The line is in
very bad shape, so we may not possibly



consider that option.”
Until last weekend, the minister
had maintained that both the lines to
Malaba and Kisumu would be revived.
Mr Macharia also said that only Sh21
billion will be needed to revive both the
old railway to Malaba and build a new
43km link from the Naivasha station,
where the SGR currently ends.
In China, he had put the figure at
Sh40 billion.
Exclusion of the Kisumu line in the
latest railway plan now edges the lakeside town from one of Kenya’s most
active transport corridors.
A proposal that will see more trucks
on the road between the two railway
lines from August has also been introduced.
This may present a pricing headache
for transporters, who will be required to
use the railway from Mombasa to Duka
Moja, where the SGR ends, and truck
their cargo to the old railway station
in Naivasha.

Mr Macharia, who was speaking after
hosting a delegation from Uganda,
maintained that transporters will have
time savings to compensate for any
cost implications of the road transport
between the two railway lines.
The Uganda team, led by Works and
Transport Minister Monica Azuba, is on
a week-long tour of Kenya to follow up
on the March visit by President Yoweri
Museveni. SGR talks took centre stage
during Mr Museveni’s visit, including
an offer of land for Uganda to build a
dry port in Naivasha.
“We’re very happy for the land offer in
Naivasha, and we hope to see it during
our tour, which will proceed all the way
to the Malaba border,” Ms Azuba said.


**Good news to businesses**
After the failure to secure funding
for the Naivasha-Kisumu stretch of the
SGR, residents along the old railway
line had hoped that the new plan to
revive the old railway was their rebound. This followed Mr Macharia’s
announcement to that effect.
But the latest twist may be good news
for various businesses, which had leased
railway station buildings and converted
them to bars, restaurants and churches.
Kisumu was to be a big player in the
lake transport corridor, with some Sh14
billion having been part of the SGR plan
that now remains in limbo.

A lobby is planning to mobilise the
public to raise money for former anti-corruption tsar and whistle-blower
John Githongo, who was ordered to pay
Sh27 million to former Cabinet minister
Christopher Murungaru for linking him
to corruption over 10 years ago.
Mr Wilfred Olal, the coordinator of the
National Social Justice Centres (NSJC),
said they will seek to be enjoined in an
appeal where Mr Githongo will be chal


lenging the High Court verdict.
“Mr Githongo is supposed to be
treated as a whistle-blower and not as a
criminal considering that he had to flee
the country for some time fearing for his
life,” Mr Olal said in a press statement
yesterday.
In the appeal, he said they will argue
that the case was a public interest matter
that did not warrant the award of damages to the former minister.
“We will seek to advance public interest, argue against the punitive award



and make clear our intention to pay
the award, if the court persists, as the
expose was for the benefit of Wanjiku,”
Mr Olal said.
Should the court direct that the award
be paid, the lobby said it will mobilise
citizens with bowls to collect Sh1 coins
from the public.
The “Murungaru bowls”, as they will
be called, will be available in major towns
in the country, as soon as the judgment
is delivered.
The lobby group also plans to look for



Mr Murungaru to ask him to contribute
the one shilling.
Mr Olal also said that to hasten
the war against corruption, the government should enact and adopt the
Whistleblower Protection Bill to protect
whistle-blowers and witnesses.
NSJC is a countrywide community-based membership movement whose
objective is to promote human rights
and good governance and monitor
government excesses in public affairs."

A lobby has fi led a case in court to push for
the reinstatement of three electoral agency
commissioners.
The International Human Rights Defenders
Care Well Society, in a suit fi led yesterday,
said Independent Electoral and Boundaries
Commission chairman Wafula Chebukati
acted unreasonably when he stopped the
three from taking their jobs.
Mr Chebukati earlier said Ms Consolata
Nkatha, Ms Margaret Mwachoya and Mr Paul
Kurgat would not be allowed back following
their public resignation on April 16.
He said the three resigned from IEBC and
even returned the commission’s property.
The group said Mr Chebukati violated
the law and demonstrated his intentions ""in
word and deed"".
It said Mr Chebukati is not the their
employer and that locking their offi ces was
unlawful.
The High Court last week stopped the three
from resuming duty, pending the hearing
and determination of an application by Mr
Okiya Omtatah — an activist — who wants
the resignations upheld.
Mr Omtatah said he seeks to protect the
Constitution and the rule of law, “which are
threatened by the action of the three”.
“The application seeks to stop the resumption of duty by the three, who have announced
and demonstrated their shameless resolve to
resume duty, after they voluntarily resigned
on April 16, 2018,” Mr Omtatah in the court

papers says.
He argues that the three stated under oath
that they formally resigned from the IEBC
by writing to the President and had handed
over their offi ces.
“Later, they cleared with the IEBC,” Mr
Omtatah says.
According to the activist, the “former”
commissioners “purport to have rescinded
the decision to resign by relying on sections
of a judgment delivered recently, which failed
to resolve the controversy surrounding their
action”.
The court will give directions on the case
on September 17.

enya wants Beijing to foot half
of the cost of extending the
〇〇〇

to Kisumu, in what could be the latest
move by Nairobi to slow down on debt.
During a bilateral meeting with
China’s Xi Jinping, President Uhuru
Kenyatta indicated that the cost of the
270km extension should be split into a
loan and a grant to relieve the country.
A source in the Presidency privy
to the discussions said the President
wants China to arrange the fi nancing,
but only as long as Nairobi pays just
half the cost.
“The Naivasha-Kisumu phase of the
SGR will cost $3.8 billion. And owing
to its regional signifi cance, I would
request that 50 per cent of its cost be
provided as part of grant fi nancing,”
President Kenyatta told his host.
The meeting, the third on Chinese
soil, was expected to secure fi nancing
deals for infrastructure. But facing
critics back home for alleged irresponsible borrowing, President Kenyatta’s
bid, if accepted by Beijing, could mean
taxpayers will foot only half of the
estimated Sh380 billion railroad.
The President was telling his host
about Nairobi’s readiness to play
into China’s Belt and Road Initiative,
President Xi’s policy vision to connect
Eurasia, Africa, Europe and the Americas through trade and infrastructure.

fi rst phase from Mombasa to Nairobi
was completed last year at a cost of

But with public debt reaching Sh5.1
trillion, President Uhuru Kenyatta’s
delegation also proposed a change in
the public private partnership (PPP)
in fi nancing for other infrastructural
projects. PPP might prevent the public
from choking under a huge repayment
bill, but critics say the projects might
actually cost more as the fi nanciers
recoup their money operating them
for some time.
For example, Kenya secured a PPP
deal to build a 30-kilometre expressway
from the Jomo Kenyatta International
Airport to Westlands in Nairobi. The
road is to be fi nanced by China, but
Beijing will do the tolling until it recoups its money.

three-yearly conference where Beijing
meets African leaders.

interior of Africa.
“The SGR sits very well on the Belt

envisaged land bridge between the Indian and Atlantic Oceans, opening up
the interior for trade and investment
across seven countries, and opening
China to Central Africa, and further
on, beyond the Atlantic Ocean,” the
President said.

he Standard Gauge Railway has

basa port with very little being shipped
back, according to operations data from
Kenya Railways Corporation.
The data show that for every 7.8
tonnes of cargo ferried inland by the
trains, just 1.01 tonnes is railed back
to the port, scuttling hopes that Kenya
would benefi t by using the line to export
goods. This has fanned fears that the
Chinese have turned the railway into a
convenient tool to ship in cheap imports.
The infl ux of such imports has been
fl agged for being detrimental to the
country’s industrialisation, with manufacturing being one of President Uhuru
Kenyatta’s legacy projects.
Between January 2018 when the SGR
cargo freight services started and April
2019, some 3.7 million tonnes have left
the port through the railway service
with only 484,197 tonnes ferried back
via SGR, according to internal analysis
by Kenya Railways Corporation (KRC).
The data obtained by the _Nation_ also
shows that the government was ferrying
close to 300 containers every month
on SGR after a circular was issued in
mid-2018, compelling all government
departments to use the SGR in trans

An operations contract signed between the China Roads and Bridges
Corporation and KRC detailed in a

Railways with heavy operations and
maintenance fees, many of which are
highly variable.


**Generous grace period**

Under the deal, which allowed a
special purpose operating company to
be registered in Kenya to run the SGR,
Kenya Railways was compelled to lend
the Chinese operator Sh3.5 billion in a
sweetheart deal without any interest on
repayment and generous grace period.
The operator does not have to pay
back the money in cash. Instead, a highly
variable service payment structure is
used to cancel out the debt in a unique
case where Kenya became the lender


〇〇〇


〇〇〇

to the Chinese company, who built the
railway line at over Sh400 billion.
The railway operator, which incidentally built the line, was paid Sh1.3 billion
to mobilise equipment and familiarise
with the site, which it had worked in
for close to four years, according to the
secret pact.
A special reserve account was also
set to be maintained with Sh3 billion
as part of the starting preconditions to
cushion the operator’s cash fl ow. This is
set to rise to Sh4 billion from next year.
Even sweeter for CRBC, the operating company — Africa Star Railway
Operations Company, registered in
Kenya — has been used to relieve the
Chinese operator from any liabilities
under the contract.
In fact, even where some fi nancial
culpability has been found on CRBC,
it cannot be made to pay more than 10


〇〇〇

per cent of what it earns as quarterly
fi xed services fees, even if the losses
are from the operator’s fault.
Furthermore, the operator was only
required to give a performance bond of
Sh600 million.
The monthly payments, which are
made in a mix of Kenya shillings and
US dollars, averages Sh1.8 billion every
month.
Compared to the Sh5.7 billion SGR
made in its fi rst year of operation, the
future of the project, whose loans are
due from January 2020, remains grim.
The special purpose operating
company has CRBC as the majority
shareholder but details of other owners
said to comprise locals remain scanty.
Insiders say local partners comprise
influential government officials in
the Transport ministry and powerful
politicians.

The electoral commission has
declined a request by Mr Musalia
Mudavadi’s ANC party to remove
nominated MP Godfrey Osotsi from
its party list that was submitted
ahead of the August 8, 2017 General
Election.
In a letter dated May 15, 2019
to the Independent Electoral and
Boundaries Commission (IEBC)
chairman Wafula Chebukati, ANC
acting secretary-general Barrack
Muluka had requested for a recall
of the party lists for “purposes of
review.”
Mr Muluka said the review had
been necessitated by departures of
members from the party through
resignations, failure to renew
membership and natural attrition.
“We are writing to inform you that
the party has resolved to recall the
ANC party lists currently with the
IEBC for purposes of review. Accordingly, the party now considers
the present lists obsolescent and
would wish to resubmit reviewed
lists for future consideration,” Mr
Muluka said.
Although Mr Osotsi’s case does
not fall under the reasons cited by
Mr Muluka, it could be connected
to the decision by the Registrar of
Political Parties Anne Nderitu to
endorse the request by ANC disciplinary committee to expel him
over abuse of offi ce claims.
〇〇〇


However, Mr Chebukati has
rejected the ANC request. In his
response of May 23, Mr Chebukati
told Mr Muluka the lists are required to be in the custody of the
commission at least 45 days before
〇〇〇


a general election. “The party lists
submitted by your party, therefore,
remain valid until 2022 unless for
reasons provided by law,” he said.

to build new baseload capacity
to replace ageing diesel-fired
generation and serve planned future economic growth. But now,
the new report says, the project
has been overtaken by events,
particularly lower-than-projected
demand growth, lower forecasted generation from Lamu,
and higher anticipated costs for
imported coal.
“These developments have
undercut the plant’s financial
viability and should prompt the
Kenyan government to cancel the
project,” the report’s lead author,
Mr David Schlissel, who is the
IEEFA Director of Resource
Planning Analysis, said.
The coal plant is scheduled
to enter commercial service in
2024 and is being built by Amu
Power Company Limited, a
single-purpose entity 51 per cent
owned by Centum Investments,
a Kenyan investment firm. The
remainder of shareholding is
held by Gulf Energy. The Amu
Power consortium also includes
Sichuan Electric Power Design
and Consulting, China Huadian
Corporation Power Operation
Company and Sichuan No. 3
Power Construction Company.
The contract for the plant
was awarded to Power Construction Corporation of China
in 2016. However, construction
has not yet started, having
been dogged by environmental
concerns that have dragged on.
Another interest in the project
is the American firm General
Electric, which in May 2018
purchased a 20 per cent stake
for $400 million (Sh40 billion)
to design, construct and maintain the 1,050-megawatt plant.
In this deal, the US firm was to
help develop an environmentally
friendly and efficient plant.
The report has used data from
the October 2016 Lahmeyer
International report; the Development of a Power Generation
and Transmission Master Plan,
Kenya, 2015-2035; and Kenya’s Updated 2017-2037 Least
Cost Power Development Plan
(LCPDP), released in June 2018
by the Energy and Petroleum

Mr Schlissel said the assumptions used by the coal plant’s
developers no longer hold true,
and that building the facility
would burden consumers with
costly power for years to come.
“Amu Power’s claims for the

cost of Lamu-generated electricity are unrealistically low, based
on outdated costs for imported
coal, and on overly optimistic
assumptions about how much
electricity the plant will generate,” Mr Schlissel said. “Using
more realistic assumptions about
future Lamu generation and coal
costs, electricity from the plant
could cost as much as $75 cents
(Sh75) per kilowatt-hour (KWh),
on average, during the years

ays after the _Nation_ exclusively reported that
〇〇〇

multibillion-shilling deal for the
operation of the Standard Gauge
Railway, an American think-tank
is warning that the taxpayer is
being forced into another Sh900
billion debt trap for the Lamu
coal power project.
The Sh900 billion will be paid
as capacity charge to Lamu Coal
owners for connecting their
generators to the national grid,
and will be due whether or not
the plant is in operation and
supplying energy to Kenyans.
As a result, experts have
warned that building the proposed 981-megawatt (MW) plant
in Lamu would be another costly
error for the country, and that
the taxpayer would be locked
into a 25-year power purchase
agreement (PPA) that would
force electricity consumers to
pay more to meet the costs of
the project.
Most nations have been aban


clean energy, and as a result
Kenya has been criticised for embracing coal-powered generators
at a cost that adds to a growing
national debt, now at $7.3 billion
(Sh739 billion), with China being
biggest lender.
In 2017, China Power Global
signed a $2 billion (Sh200 billion) deal with Amu Power for
the coal plant, while the Industrial Commercial Bank of China
agreed to finance the project for
$1.2 billion (Sh120 billion).
But now, experts are warning
that this is a bad project; another
financial goof.
The shocking details are contained in a new report released
yesterday by US-based Institute
for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA), which
conducts research and analyses
on financial and economic issues
related to energy. Its report shows
that the Kenyan taxpayer could
be forced to pay at least Sh36
billion in annual capacity charges
under the existing 25-year PPA,
even if no power is generated at
the plant.
The plant, when it was mooted,
was supposed to provide dependable power, not only for the SGR,
but also for the proposed Sh1.5
trillion Lamu Port-Southern Sudan-Ethiopia Transport project.
The three-unit power project,
first proposed in 2015, was also

taxpayer is being forced into another Sh900 billion debt trap for the Lamu coal power project.





2024 to 2037, more than 10 times
what the plant’s proponents have
claimed.”
This estimate neither includes
costs for the Lamu port upgrades
that would be required to bring
coal to the plant nor construction
of the transmission infrastructure
needed to distribute the power.
The costs of these projects would
add significantly to Lamu’s
overall impact on electricity
consumers and taxpayers.
“Kenya’s own analysis demonstrates that, when using the most
likely demand growth scenarios,
its abundant renewable resources
render no new coal generation
necessary in the country until
2029, at the earliest,” Mr Schlis


sel said.
In its application to build
Lamu, Amu Power had said
electricity from the plant would
costs just $7.2 cents (Sh70) per
KWh, and this has been a major
selling point for the facility,
but the economic and financial
analysis by the US-based agency
on the Amu data shows it to be
highly optimistic.
The Lamu PPA includes a
take-or-pay clause requiring that
annual capacity charges, which
start at Sh36 billion, be paid to
the plant’s owners, regardless
of whether the plant is actually
dispatched, as long as the plant
is available for dispatch. Second,
a portion of this annual capacity
charge is scalable, as it is linked
to the US consumer price index
(CPI) and will increase over time
as the CPI rises.
Currently, the CPI is already
eight per cent higher than it was
in 2014, and is expected to climb
another 10 per cent by 2024,
when the plant is scheduled to
come online. Further increases
would likely occur after the plant
enters into commercial service.
In its application, Amu Power
projected that coal for the plant
could be imported for Sh5,000
per metric tonne (mt). In contrast, Kenya’s own estimates
expect imported coal costs to
average Sh10,000/mt next year,
and rise to Sh10,800/mt in 2040.
“In other words, Lamu’s fuel
costs will be double what the
company estimated in its 2014
proposal. Finally, the company’s
electricity price estimate depends on the plant operating at
extremely high capacity factors,
levels that the plant is unlikely to
reach,” Mr Schlissel said.
Already, the new 310MW Lake
Turkana Wind Farm, which came
online at the end of September
2018, has displaced, at lower
cost, a significant amount of generation that had previously been
produced by thermal units; and
the ageing and expensive diesel
generation, which also puts the
viability of the Lamu coal plant



to test. Kenya also has transmission interconnections with
Ethiopia and Uganda, which are
developing their own renewable
resources that might be available
for import.
“Kenya Power already has
a 25-year PPA with Ethiopian
Electric Power through which
it will receive 400MW of firm
power with related energy at a
cost of $7 cents (Sh7) per KWh.
As this PPA also has a take-or-pay
clause, Kenya Power will have
to pay for this power, even if it
is displaced by electricity from
Lamu,” the report said.
Efforts to get a comment from
the Energy ministry proved futile
as calls placed to the Principal
Secretary, Mr Joseph Njoroge,
went unanswered. Amu Power,
on the other hand, told the _Na-_
_tion_ this new report’s analysis is
inaccurate.
The consortium argued that,
according to the 2017-2037
Least Cost Power Development
Plan, Kenya expects an energy
demand of between 1,754MW
and 9,790MW.
“We anticipate that the coal
power plant will have utilisation rate of around 95 per cent,
meaning Kenyans will only pay
for energy consumed and no
capacity charge will be accrued,”
Amu Power chief operating officer Cyrus Kirima said.
“We also wish to clarify that
the coal power will retail at a cost
of tariff of $0.7.8/kWh (Sh78)
which was locked during the
signing of the power purchase
agreement.”
Amu Power argues that the
Lamu coal power plant will
provide baseload capacity at the
second cheapest non-subsidised
tariff in the country after hydro,
at $0.5/kWh (Sh50).
“This plant will have the flexibility to profile the generation
according to the daily demand
pattern compared to other power
production technologies that are
inflexible; reducing generation
costs by between 12 per cent
and 36 per cent,” Mr Kirima said."

enya’s key strategic assets at
home and abroad will not be
〇〇〇

and risk being seized by the Chinese government should there be
a default in repaying the Standard
Gauge Railway loan, a copy of the
contract seen by the Sunday Nation
reveals.
The initial agreement for the
Mombasa-Nairobi railway signed
on May 11, 2014 also details how
the pact will be governed by Chinese laws with all disputes being
arbitrated in Beijing. In addition,
the contract, and a subsequent one
on the Nairobi-Naivasha phase,
also have a confidentiality clause
gagging Kenya from making the
deal public “without prior written
permission of the lender (China)”.
This comes more than two weeks
after President Uhuru Kenyatta, responding to a question from NTV’s
Mark Masai during a live television
interview on December 28 last
year, promised to release the SGR
contract to put to rest any “porojo”
(rumours) that the Chinese could
seize the Port of Mombasa.
This week, State House spokesperson Kanze Dena, in response
to our enquiries, said the contract
“can be released anytime, even
this week”.
**SGR deal**
However, the signed SGR deal
seen by the Sunday Nation suggests
the risks go beyond the port.
“Neither the borrower (Kenya)
nor any of its assets is entitled
to any right of immunity on the
grounds of sovereignty or otherwise
from arbitration, suit, execution
or any other legal process with
respect to its obligations under this
Agreement, as the case may be in
any jurisdiction,” reads Clause 5.5
of the Preferential Buyer Credit
Loan Agreement on the Mombasa-Nairobi SGR.
The contract is signed by National Treasury Cabinet Secretary
Henry Rotich and Mr Li Riogu,
then Chairman and President of
the State-owned Export -Import
(Exim) Bank of China.
In the deal, Kenya is also compelled to import goods, technology
and services from China.
According to experts interviewed
for this article, the blanket reference
to “any asset” not only exposes
the Kenya ports Authority (KPA),
whose leaked audit report last
month raised questions about its
vulnerability in case of default, but
also allows the Chinese lenders to
take over other critical resources —
anything from airports and natural
resources to embassies abroad.
When we put the implications
of this clause to Mr Rotich, the
Treasury Cabinet Secretary gave
a terse response: “Where did you
get such information? Send me



where you got it from. Not aware
about such a thing.” The apparent
exposure of Kenya’s assets gets
even more curious given the clause
that says the loan agreement would
be “governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of China”.
The initial SGR loan agreement,
signed slightly over one year after
the Jubilee administration came to
power, is also designed to be kept
secret, as captured in clause 17.7 of
the loan pact. This raises questions
on the Freedom of Information
requirements by the Kenyan Constitution.
“The borrower (Kenya) shall
keep all the terms and conditions
hereunder or in connection with
this agreement strictly confidential.
Without the prior written consent
of the lender (China), the borrower
shall not disclose any information
hereunder or in connection with
this agreement to any third party
unless required by applicable law,”
reads the confidentiality clause.
**Concerns raised**
After concerns were raised last
month that KPA could potentially
be seized in case of a default in
loan repayment, Chinese officials
disputed the claim in carefully
worded statements.
Chinese Foreign Ministry
Spokesperson Hua Chunying said:
“We have checked with the relevant
Chinese financial institution and
found that the allegation that Kenyan side used the Mombasa Port
as a collateral in its payment agreement with the Chinese financial
institution for the Mombasa-Nairobi Railway is not true.”
It is a statement that could be
true if viewed with a narrow lens,
considering that there is no specific
reference to the port in the contract
seen by the Sunday Nation, but the
sweeping statement that makes

all assets fair game bears the trap.
The Chinese have repeatedly rejected accusations that they were
involved in debt-trap diplomacy
by burdening poor countries with
unsustainable loans. On Thursday,
Ms Dena, the State House spokesperson, told the Sunday Nation
there was no confidentiality clause
blocking the public release of the
entire SGR contract.
“It has nothing to do with secrecy, we have been on holiday and
we are still settling back. There is
no diplomatic barrier preventing
Kenya from making the loan deal
public. The document will be made
available even this week to everyone, through the media houses,”
Ms Dena said.
Law Society of Kenya Nairobi
Branch Chairman Charles Kanjama
said the secrecy clause is standard
for such agreements. He is, however, concerned the sovereignty
waiver on the assets and relying

on Chinese laws are signs of doubt
by the lender.
“The agreement is being made
in Kenya, the railway is built in
Kenya and the assets they are
talking about are in Kenya, so why
is it being governed by the laws of
China? Had there been more transparency or choices of who funds the
railway then Kenya may have got
a better deal,” Mr Kanjama said.
**Lending countries**
Daly and Inadmar Advocates
partner and cross border commercial contract specialist Shitul Shah
said lending countries only ask for
collateral when they had questions
on the “credibility” of the borrower
But even more intriguing is the
clause in the contract that says
any disputes on the loan would
only be resolved in Beijing through
the China International Economic
and Trade Arbitration Commission
(Cietac).
“The arbitration award shall be



final and binding on both parties.
The arbitration shall take place in
Beijing,” reads the agreement, effectively blocking other international
commercial dispute resolution

avenues.
Kenya has further signed never to
dispute the choice of Cietac as an
arbitrator and to take its decision.
Mr Shah said although parties
to a contract have the freedom to
agree on which law would govern
the agreement, China’s choice of
the arbitrator and the specification
that the arbitration would he held
in Beijing is “suspect”.
“Normally, you would need an
independent arbitrator, because this
is about mediation, which should
be made neutral and impartial by
all means. Specifying the mediator
and the unneutral ground to carry
out the mediation is suspect. This
can be challenged in law,” Mr Shah,
who also practices in New York and
London, told the Sunday Nation."

he government plans to
launch an expensive railway
〇〇〇

of nowhere after the Chinese government pulled the plug on funding
for the next phase.
Transport Cabinet Secretary
James Macharia said the government will launch four infrastructure
projects today, among them the
double-decker Nairobi express
highway, phase two of the Standard
Gauge Railway (SGR) line to Suswa,
a water project in Kimuka and an
Inland Container Depot terminal
in Maai Mahiu.
Details of the launch being
organised by the Presidential Delivery Unit (PDU) have been highly
guarded, a big departure from the
glamour that came with the launch
of the Mombasa-Nairobi line.
Mr Macharia said that after the
launch of the express highway that
will connect Cabanas to Westlands,
President Uhuru Kenyatta will go
to the SGR Nairobi station before
heading to Ongata Rongai, Ngong
and Maai Mahiu. He will later commission the Suswa station.
“We shall fi rst launch the passenger service and the freight one will
come after two months,” he said in
an interview with the _Nation._
The phase extending the line
from Nairobi to Naivasha is estimated to have cost Sh150 billion.



However, the entire line has not
been completed.
The passenger line expected to
start operations today will ferry
travellers to only four of the 12
stations — Ongata Rongai, Ngong,
Maai Mahiu and Suswa.
The _Nation_ has learnt that even
the Chinese contractors who build
the line are also groping in the
dark, with a source familiar with
the project saying they had been
told that “their presence may not
really be required”.
In what is set to be one of the
biggest challenges to face the line,
the government is staring at a line
that ends in the wilderness, kilometres away from any major town
or population that could have fully



utilised the line.
The lack of enough volumes of
cargo has also made things worse
for the line. This has forced the
government to start with the passenger line, and shelve the cargo
side to a later date. This is the
opposite of what happened with
the Mombasa-Nairobi line where
the cargo line started operations
months before the offi cial launch.
A passenger line, the world over,
cannot operate profi tably without
being subsidised by the cargo side
of the business. It was hoped that
the Naivasha special economic zone
would open up the region and bring
in new demand for cargo.
But this is yet to be actualised.
The long-drawn-out fight over
delays in compensation for land
between landowners and the government also saw the project suff er
massive delays.
The fact that travellers to Naivasha and Nakuru cannot use the



MACHARIA MWANGI | NATION

be launched today although the entire line to Naivasha has not been completed.



line in its current form only makes
it harder. The last time the _Nation_
visited the line, the contractors
were working on the line from the
Duka Moja area. The stretch from
Maai Mahiu to Naivasha is not yet
complete.
But the biggest setback for the
line came in April when the Chinese
government refused to fund the rest
of the line to Kisumu over viability
concerns given that Uganda was
not yet on board and Kenya on its
own lacks enough cargo to make
the line feasible.
Kenya needed Sh380 billion
to complete the line to Kisumu.
Instead, the Chinese government
only parted with Sh40 billion for
upgrading the metre-gauge railway
between Naivasha and Malaba as
a compromise.
It is not clear why the Chinese
government decided to fund Phase
2A of the line to Naivasha and
abandon it halfway through, but it



came as a slap on the face of the
Kenyan government, given that it
had been allowed to have its way
on dictating terms on phase one,
having done almost everything
from the feasibility study and construction to buying locomotives,
supervision and operation.
But when the time came, it
waved the “show suffi cient proof
of viability” card in the faces of a
government delegation that had
been invited to Beijing.
To save the situation, the government resorted to connecting
the new line to the old line at
Naivasha, which will mean that
cargo and passengers will have to
be moved to the metre-gauge line
while in transit.
This comes at a time when
truckers are up in arms protesting a
move by the Transport ministry to
force cargo owners to use the SGR,
a directive that they argue fails the
test of a free-market economy."

At least 30 police officers
are under investigation after
two of them were found to
have received bribes amounting to Sh37 million through
M-Pesa.
Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC)
Chief Executive Halakhe
Waqo said the officers under
investigation were based on
Thika highway.
The policemen are believed
to be part of a racket extorting
bribes from motorists on the
highway.
According to the EACC
boss, one of the two officers
was found to have transacted
Sh30 million using his M-Pesa
account in a period of seven
months.
His suspected accomplice
had on the other hand transacted a total of Sh7.8 million
using his M-Pesa account during the same period.
He said the money was
sent to the officers’ M-Pesa
accounts by a boda boda
rider suspected to be part of
the cartel.
The cartel’s victims would
send their bribes to the boda
boda rider’s M-Pesa account
and he would in turn forward
the same to the officers who
would quickly withdraw it.
“The cases are now being
handled by the Thika court
as we continue to follow the
others who are part of the
cartel,” Mr Waqo said in an
interview with reporters on
the sidelines of the governors’
summit at Diani Reef Hotel in
Kwale County.
The revelation came after
the governors raised concern
over continued harassment
by officers from the anti-graft
agency. The governors complained that the agency was
targeting them in the war
against corruption.
Mr Waqo said the commission was overwhelmed by the
high number of corruption
cases given its lean staff.
Stating that the war against
corruption was a collective responsibility, Mr Waqo said it
was not an easy one as some
people withdrew cases, witnesses disappeared while
some players scuttled investigations.
He said some county workers conspired with outsiders
to loot money and gave an
example of the theft of Sh52
million through collusion between bank staff and officials
of a county government he did
not name.
Responding to Kiambu
Governor Ferdinand Waititu,
Mr Waqo said the commission
will not bend the law to allow
counties to buy second-hand
goods. “We shall investigate
if any second-hand material
is bought. That is the law,”
he said.
Mr Waqo named Hong Kong
as one of the places where a
huge budget of about Sh12
billion is allocated to the fight



against corruption.
He said EACC, which has
come under intense criticism
over its failure to fight high
level corruption in the country, was not targeting a specific
class of people and that was
why even boda boda riders
were not spared.
Mr Waqo said he was also
being wrongly accused of
targeting officials in northern
Kenya counties where he hails
from in the pretext that he was
eyeing an elective seat.
EACC is investigating
some 3,243 cases of corruption across the 47 counties, he
said. Nairobi County has the
most cases (408), followed by
Isiolo with 192 cases, Garissa
(173), Kisumu (158) and Kisii
(146).
Mr Waqo said the commission received 4,242 complaints
on corruption between 2013
and September this year.

shift from politics and concentrate on the four issues for the
improvement of Kenyans’ lives.
“During the next five years, I
will dedicate the energy, time
and resources of my administration to the big four,” said the
President.
He said in the second phase
of the standard gauge railway
(SGR), the line will be linked to
the depot, connecting Nairobi
with the rest of the East African
region via rail. This will boost
efforts to improve the movement
and management of cargo across
the country and the region.


**SGR freight train**
“The high speed, high capacity and efficient standard gauge
railway network will serve as
an important link between the
Port of Mombasa and the inland container depot,” said the
President.
According to President Kenyatta, from a regional perspective,
the SGR freight train will reduce
the cost of doing business across
East Africa.
Earlier, the Head of State
inspected the SGR tunnel at
Em-Bulbul and expressed satisfaction with the progress of
the project.
The Em-Bulbul SGR tunnel
in Kajiado County covers 4.5
kilometres. It is the first of the
three sections of the 7.14km
SGR tunnel, the second longest
railway tunnel in Africa.
The railway tunnel is part of
phase 2A of the SGR project that
takes the modern railway line
from Nairobi to Naivasha and
then to Narok.

our development programmes,”
said President Kenyatta.
In his Jamhuri Day speech,
President Kenyatta listed
security, affordable housing,
manufacturing and inexpensive
healthcare as the key areas his
administration will focus on
during his final term.
The President described the
pillars as the big four, which
he will use to transform Kenya
economically and leave a lasting legacy after his five-year
tenure.
He said his administration will



“All the counties face corruption complaints which is
a worrying situation. In our
probe, Nairobi tops the list
because it is the largest city,”
said Mr Waqo.
He noted that the cases
mostly originate from the
county assemblies, procurement departments, public
service offices, land offices and
at the health departments.
“These are the most prone
areas and that is why we are
now asking you (governors) to
cooperate with us in this fight.
One of the major challenges
that we face as a commission
is the lack of cooperation,”
he said.
He added that there was a
need for the governors to improve their cooperation with
the commission to identify the
problem and deal with it for
better service delivery.

he Kenyan Chamber of
Commerce has described

threat to national security.
It has warned of an impending liquidity pressure ahead of
the fi rst repayment period in
June next year.
In a memorandum to the
National Assembly, the lobby
said the rising debt, now at
Sh5.1 trillion, and which, it said,
is 8.1 per cent higher than the
accepted level of 50 per cent,
could soon result in a crisis that
may devastate the economy.
“The private sector has noted
that the rising debt is becoming
a threat to prosperity, security,
stability and good governance.
The government spends approximately 70 per cent of what
is collected on debt repayment.
There is a possible liquidity
pressure which could arise from
the large debt instrument maturities, especially the fi ve-year
Eurobond due in June 2019 that
could result in more borrowing
to pay off,” the chamber said in
its memorandum to Parliament.
It added that commercial
loans, such as Eurobonds and
money from China, are expensive and could result in even
more stress on the country’s







acquisition and compensation
information, “as the same data
is available at the respective
acquiring entity”.
“We assure the general public
of continued services and urge
them to ignore any contrary
information appearing in some
sections of the media,” Mr
Salim said.
The computer believed to hold
crucial information connected to
the case in which Dr Swazuri and
others are accused of irregularly
compensating landowners for
the Mombasa-Nairobi standard
gauge railway phase, which was
completed in June last year,
disappeared mysteriously from
NLC offi ces in Nairobi.

and procedures or matters related to compensation.
The theft, according to the
statement, occurred during the
weekend.
Mr Salim also dismissed
reports that the theft occurred
in NLC chairman Muhammad
Swazuri’s offi ce.


**SGR compensation data**
The communications chief
went on to say that the theft
has been reported to relevant
investigative agencies and at
Kilimani police station.
The commission, according
to the statement, is not the only
custodian of compulsory land



economy, given that projects
take long to be completed.
It said repayment of the loans
begins before Kenyans start
reaping the benefi ts.
“As the government borrows
more, Kenya will become more
susceptible to external market
conditions and shocks,” the
agency said, calling on Parliament to be involved in setting



the ceiling, sources and the
purpose of domestic borrowing.
“The government should
borrow only for development
expenditure, while maximising
on external concessional loans
and keeping commercial loans
limited to projects with very
high economic returns,” the
chamber advised.
It called for an export-driven
economy by encouraging
growth in manufacturing.
The chamber said manufacturing would increase the value
on exports, thus improving the
country’s account defi cit.


**Bill drafted**
“The government should
encourage private sector involvement in development
projects in order to reduce the
strain on expenditure and hence
borrowing,” the lobby said,
calling for diversification in
the public-private partnership
projects ""concentrated on the
energy industry alone"".
Emgwen MP Alex Kosgey has
already drafted a bill seeking to
limit the amount that Kenya can
borrow to Sh6 trillion.
According to the bill, the
National Treasury should justify the amount borrowed and
set out clearly the modes of
repayment.
“The Treasury should seek
the approval of Parliament
before any borrowing, and the
government should ensure its
fi nancing needs are met from
the cheapest lending sources in
the market while ensuring the
overall public debt is sustainable,” the bill proposes.



The National Land Commission has denied media reports
that data stolen days ago was
not backed up.
The commission yesterday
said the information contained
in the stolen central processing
unit is available in its backup
systems.
Acknowledging the loss of
the CPU at the Directorate
of Valuation and Taxation,
NLC Communications Director
Khalid Salim said in a statement
that it would not aff ect the operations of the commission.
The loss, the statement added,
would not upset or compromise

enya is shortly expected to
sign a Sh368 billion loan
〇〇〇

the Naivasha-Kisumu leg of the
Standard Gauge Railway, bringing the total debt for the project
to Sh845 billion and making the
cost effectively Sh800 million
per kilometre — one of the most
expensive projects of its kind in
the world.
President Uhuru Kenyatta and
opposition leader Raila Odinga
are in China to persuade that
country’s leadership to extend
the loan. The inclusion of Mr
Odinga in the delegation to
China came as a surprise as he
has been a fierce critic of the government over the SGR project.
The cost of Sh800 million for
every kilometre of railway between Mombasa and Kisumu is
twice the international average.
People familiar with the trip
say the new loan is a “done
deal” now that the issues raised
during President Kenyatta’s
previous trip to Beijing had been
addressed.



An advance delegation left the
country on Monday. It comprised
Treasury Principal Secretary
Kamau Thugge, Kenya Railways
Corporation acting managing
director Philip Mainga, and
officials from the Transport
ministry.
Transport and Infrastructure Cabinet Secretary James
Macharia and his Treasury
counterpart Henry Rotich are
also expected in China for the
signing ceremony.
It is understood negotiations
around the latest loan have been
a lot tougher than the first two.
Besides viability issues, the numbers coming through are not as
promising as initially thought.
Phase One of the SGR gobbled
up Sh327 billion before factoring
in loan interest fees and land
acquisition costs. About 90 per
cent of this amount, or Sh294
billion, was a part-concessional-part-commercial loan from
Exim Bank of China.
The Kenyan government
was expected to contribute the
remaining 10 per cent, which
translates to about Sh32.7 billion,
from the Railway Development
Levy, while land acquisition
was to cost Sh15 billion, but this
amount was inflated and the
country ended up with a bill of
almost two times the amount.
Phase 2A, which is the stretch
between Nairobi and Naivasha,



has already consumed another
Sh150 billion. Phase 2B is the
Naivasha to Kisumu line and
included the development of
a new high-capacity port at
Kisumu. It is expected to cost
Sh368billion and is the subject
of the current loan negotiations
in China. There is a final Phase
2C, which will take the line from
Kisumu to Malaba.
Cumulatively, stretching the
line from Mombasa to Kisumu
will cost a total of Sh845 billion
for the 996-kilometre line, making it the biggest infrastructure
project Kenya has ever undertaken. Together with interests
and land acquisition, the line
will cost over Sh1 trillion, which
is almost the total amount of
money collected by the taxman

every year.
Last year, SGR operations
posted Sh10 billion in losses
despite costing the taxpayer at
least Sh12 billion to operate. It
costs about Sh1 billion a month
to run the line between Nairobi
and Mombasa.
Delays by Uganda to complete
negotiations and break ground
for construction of a line from
the border with Kenya to Kampala had made taking the line
beyond Naivasha less promising
from a financial perspective.
Also, some of the sticky issues
around the deal include what assets will be tied up on the loan. In
the first phase, the government
was said to have handed over
the Port of Mombasa as security
for the loan. It denied the claim.
The other issue that needs to
be resolved is where disputes
will be resolved should they
arise. The initial contract had
indicated that all disputes of
the government-to-government
deal will be arbitrated in Beijing,
but Kenya is understood to be
pushing to shift the arbitration
location to a more neutral location such as Geneva or any other
internationally acceptable court.
In Beijing, when President
Uhuru Kenyatta and his Chinese
hosts sit to discuss details of
the financing, Mr Odinga will
be unlikely, but invited, guest
at the table.
Mr Odinga was, for a long



time, one of the harshest critics
of the financing model of President Kenyatta’s pet project,
saying in various forums that
the President’s borrowing spree
was akin to mortgaging Kenya
to China.
Accusing President Kenyatta’s
government of corruption, Mr
Odinga said the cost of Mombasa-Nairobi line was exaggerated
and could have cost less, and
when the President launched
construction of the line from
Nairobi to Naivasha, the opposition leader claimed it was all
for the benefit of members of
the first family.
In June 2014 Mr Odinga wrote
to the President lamenting that
the SGR project, “which is a
key and vital development in
the expansion and modernisation of Kenya’s infrastructure,
has raised serious credibility
concerns”. He said the project
should have cost Sh227 billion
but was inflated to Sh327 billion
by the Jubilee administration.
“We know the people responsible,” he warned, “and it is not
the Chinese.”
But now, as he basks in the
glory of his March 2018 deal
with Mr Kenyatta, Mr Odinga
has become one of the staunchest supporters of the project,

and was last evening cruising
to China to lend support to his
new political ally.
Speaking in Kisumu at the
weekend, Mr Odinga said the
project would be a big boost to
the economy of Kisumu as it
would create jobs for the people.
""We are going to establish a
special economic zone in Kisumu and make the city the hub
of East Africa,"" he told a crowd.
Mr Odinga was not available
for comment, but his spokesman
Dennis Onyango said the ODM
leader’s stand on the first phase
of the SGR had not changed,
and that there was no value for

money.
“However,” added Mr Onyango, “now that we are already
committed to it as it is already
here, we need to beef it up to
make value for money by extending it to Kisumu and Busia.”
But Kiharu MP Ndindi Nyoro
interpreted Mr Odinga’s aboutturn as inconsistent and read
malice in his earlier opposition
to the project. “His position on
being the most inconsistent
politician in the region is unrivalled,” said Mr Nyoro. “In Mr
Odinga’s books, Eurobond was
a ‘scam’ before the handshake
and a revolutionary financing
vehicle afterwards. Kenya was



taking so much debt before the
handshake, but we appear able to
absorb more debt now and he’s
headed to China to take more.
That's Raila.”
But Mr Onyango denied that
Mr Odinga had changed his position on the SGR, saying that,
by extending the line beyond
Nairobi to Kisumu and Busia,
“the catchment area for the SGR
is expanding”. “It will tap into
opportunities in the Democratic
Republic of Congo, Northern
Tanzania, Uganda, Burundi,
and Rwanda,” said Mr Onyango.
In Murang’a political observers Allan Mugachi and George
Gathuru linked Mr Odinga’s
about-turn to the number of projects being taken to his Western
Kenya political base.
“He will not only support
the SGR, but also all the other
projects by the government that
he was opposed to, including
the Northern Water Collector
Tunnel, since his region is
turning out to be the biggest
beneficiary of the ‘handshake’,”
Mr Mugachi noted.
Mr Gathuru agreed, noting
that for Mr Odinga, what matters
is the fact that “he is in government and his region will benefit
from the projects”.
Only last week, Mr Odinga
called for caution over foreign
loans. “We are here to think
about what we can do for ourselves as Africans before we go
to the World Bank, EU or to
the Chinese,” he told delegates
at a summit on infrastructure
financing in Nairobi.

The Sh2.81 trillion budget
for the next financial year faces
serious delays following the High
Court ruling in September 2018
that significantly alters the traditional budget-making process
by the National Assembly.
Already the leadership of the
House has planned a retreat in
Mombasa this Friday to discuss
the way forward on the ruling
that complicates the current



budget cycle, which has been
in place for the past six years.
The retreat led by House
Speaker Justin Muturi will also
discuss the rising national debt
and the census in August.
Speaker Muturi confirmed
that the retreat is on, noting that
it will explore other matters of
national concern. “Yes, we are
meeting this weekend as the
House leadership to discuss
issues of national importance,”



Mr Muturi said.
In September last year, High
Court Judge Winfrida Okwany
ruled that the government cannot budget for what it has not
financed, which then calls for
the need to explore possible realignment of the budget process.
This means that the Finance
Bill, which details revenue
collection measures by the government, must be passed first
before the Appropriations Bill



is enacted before end of June.
The ruling on the case filed by
activist Okiya Omtata against
National Treasury Cabinet
Secretary Henry Rotich and
Attorney General Kihara Kariuki
has serious ramifications on the
Provisional Collection of Taxes
and Duties Act of 2018.
The government has been
using the law to collect taxes
through a legal notice published
in June last year."

enyan taxpayers paid dearly
for the comfort of Chinese

construct the first phase of the
Standard Gauge Railway (SGR),
including furnishing their houses
and paying for their domestic staff .
This is despite the fact that the
Chinese were not only remunerated
better than their Kenyan counterparts who were paid per day, thanks
to lose contracts.
The Chinese were also eligible for
overtime payments.
A strong army of 5,795 Chinese
workers were brought in for the
construction of the fi rst phase of
SGR, way above the 2,000 fi gure
given by the contractor, China Road
and Bridge Corporation (CRBC).
Amid heavy critism by the public
and Kenyan workers that there
were too many Chinese staff on the
project, CRBC had in 2016 claimed
it had only hired 2,000 foreigners.
“The project releases recruitment
information and holds job fairs in
the locality, drawing residents from
neighbouring communities into
railway construction,” CRBC told
the _Business Daily_ at the time.
The company further said it had
hired some 19,858 Kenyans to work
alongside the Chinese who had
been brought into the country to
undertake management and technical duties.
However, the project’s contract
shows CRBC may have been economical with the truth.
In fact, it does not mention the


〇〇〇


〇〇〇

total number of local personnel
hired for the project. This means
their employment may not have
been structured.
Signs of these skewed employment terms started becoming
apparent just two weeks after President Uhuru Kenyatta witnessed the
laying of the fi rst 500-metre SGR
track at Mtito Andei in Makueni
County on February 1, 2015.
Kenyan workers — who were
being paid Sh400 per day for casual
labour, Sh700 for machine operators


〇〇〇


〇〇〇

worked in shifts — were not eligible
for the allowance.
Part of the payments made in
lump sum to CRBC for preliminary works was Sh42.9 million for
overtime pay for junior staff, Sh12
million as allowances for trainees,
Sh30 million for miscellaneous
expenses and Sh30 million for
supervisory works.
Taxpayers also paid for furnished
accommodation for 10 senior engineers at Sh3,074,211 each. The
second grade of engineers, who
numbered 20, got furnished houses
at Sh2,818,027 each.
The fi ve top engineers also got
furnished offices at Sh4,211,005
each. This is besides a further Sh7.6
million, which was to be used to pay
for temporary accommodation, in
case they could not make it to their
houses at night.
In total, CRBC splashed over
Sh1.3 billion on maintaining the
top fi ve engineers. Their offi ces and
houses alone cost Sh544 million


〇〇〇


〇〇〇

and Sh650 for drivers — downed
their tools, saying CRBC was paying
them poorly.
The striking workers, who numbered about 300 and were working
on the Mombasa to Mtito wa Ndei
section, also complained there was
an infl ux of workers brought in from
China to do “manual jobs which
locals could handle eff ectively.”
On its Bill of Quantities, CRBC
sought accommodation for 5,795
Chinese personnel. They were paid
handsomely and lived lavishly at
Kenyan taxpayers’ expense.
The foreigners were grouped into
two broad categories — senior and
junior staff who numbered 95.
The other category, which had
5,700 personnel, were just labelled
as ‘staff ’ and were distinguished by
their grades; from Type 1 to Type 5.
These were the low cadre employees
like machine operators.
Unlike the Chinese junior staff
who were paid for working overtime,
their Kenyan counterparts — who

to furnish and maintain, which
included Sh72 million allocated to
pay their domestic staff .
Maintenance of accommodation
quarters for Chinese junior staff
was budgeted for according to their
categories. Construction of the
temporary residences — made of
pre-cast material — used during the
period cost Sh200 million.
The category one staff, who
totalled 600, had their quarters
maintained at a monthly cost of
Sh12,274 while category two staff,
numbering 1,200, had their quarters maintained at Sh11,251.80 per
month. Category three staff, who
also numbered 1,200, had their
quarters maintained at Sh9,206.
The 2,400 category four staff
had their quarters maintained at
Sh6,137 per month while category
fi ve, who numbered 300, had their
houses maintained at Sh3,580 daily.
The total cost for maintaining the
houses of the junior staff totalled
Sh48 million.

enya has signed three more
trade agreements with China
〇〇〇

billions of shillings to fund phase
two of the Standard Gauge Railway.
On his third visit to China in just
eight months, President Uhuru
Kenyatta and his host Xi Jinping
yesterday witnessed the signing
of three key agreements that will,
on the surface, open up markets
and training opportunities, but
whose strings are also attached to
infrastructure development.
Trade Cabinet Secretary Peter
Munya and Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi put pen to paper at the
Chinese Great Hall of the People in
Beijing to seal deals on economic
and technical cooperation and the
protocol on sanitary requirements
to allow Nairobi to export hass
avocados.
Nairobi also agreed on an MoU
on joint promotion of the economic
and trade measures of the eight key
initiatives under the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC), a
three-yearly conference organised
by Beijing to leverage its influence
on the continent.
State House said in a statement that the meeting focused on
FOCAC areas, adding that China
has been a key player in Kenya’s
economic development. The eight
initiatives targeting Africa and



worth Sh6 trillion are contained
in President Xi Jinping’s “Socialism with Chinese Characteristics”
policy. They involve industrial promotion, infrastructure connectivity,
trade facilitation, green development, capacity-building, healthcare,
people-to-people exchange and
peace and security.
The three deals mean Beijing has
signed at least 20 agreements and
MoUs with Nairobi under President
Uhuru Kenyatta’s tenure. Most of
them touch on issues such as science, wildlife and environmental
cooperation, financial settlement,
infrastructure and trade improve

yesterday ahead of the second Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation.



One solution is for Nairobi to
attach the SGR to the BRI in order
to get favourable loan conditions.
“The SGR has made Kenya the
preferred entry point and exit
route for some of our neighbouring
countries and is transforming them
from landlocked to coastal nations
by facilitating the development
of dedicated and efficient inland
ports,” Transport CS James Macharia yesterday told a gathering of
government officials and experts
from countries tagged to the BRI.
“The SGR’s performance has
exceeded our expectations. More
than 2.6 million passengers have
been transported since its commissioning and more than 3.6 million
tons of cargo hauled,” he said. If
the money is released, it could
firmly put Beijing in pole position
as Kenya’s biggest bilateral creditor.



Kenyan officials were, however,
hoping that some of the monies
could come in as a grant.
China issued a pledge of Sh6
trillion last September, including
Sh1.5 trillion in grants and another
Sh1.5 trillion in interest-free loans.
The latter, however, prioritises
least developed and landlocked
countries.
As part of the eight initiatives,
China is also to fund security assistance programmes within the
BRI to “build capacity in African
countries for peace and security,
safeguard security of trade routes
between China and Africa.”
President Xi, according to Chinese media, will seek to “strengthen
cooperation with Kenya on important projects and encourage more
Chinese companies to invest in
Kenya”.







ment and are worth billions of
shillings.
Yesterday’s deals also mean that
Beijing was technically merging
FOCAC with the Belt and Road
Initiative (BRI), a programme
meant to expand Chinese influence
across the globe through trade and
infrastructure development.
And, amid nagging questions on
the debt burden, Kenyan officials
were yesterday still lobbying for the
conclusion of a financial agreement
that could see Beijing release about
Sh368 billion to finance Phase 2B
of the Standard Gauge Railway.
The SGR falls within the Belt
and Road Initiative and will open
up the African hinterland once it
reaches the interior and is viable.
But it could be expensive for Kenya,
which may have to repay a loan of
more than Sh800 billion."

_The drivers of public debt have_

_In the Sh3.3 trillion budget for_

_However, PBO says that debt ser-_

_for up to 10 per cent of the GDP_
_by the end of the medium term._
_“At this level, it will have out-_

_per cent, and will be rising fast-_

_share of GDP, estimated to de-_
_cline to 10.8 per cent in the cur-_
_rent financial year,” the PBO doc-_
_ument reads._



_Empirical evidence gathered_
_by the budget office suggests that_
_high debt-to-GDP ratio has a det-_
_rimental effect on the growth_
_rate of an economy._
_The PBO document shows that,_
_past a given critical point — for_
_instance between 64 per cent and_
_100 per cent depending on the_
_nature of the economy — an in-_
_crease in the ratio leads to eco-_
_nomic losses._
_“The debt-to-GDP ratio should,_
_thus, not be allowed to reach lev-_
_els that would affect the econom-_
_ic growth rate negatively as this_
_would lengthen the fiscal consol-_
_idation period,” the budget office_
_document says._
_To wiggle out, the budget office_
_says that the government will re-_
_quire fiscal consolidation._
_This includes achieving the 10_
_per cent economic growth rate_
_projected in the economic pillar_
_of the Vision 2030, a key target in_
_debt control parameters._
_The experts further say that_
_the primary focus should, there-_
_fore, be given to sectors that are_
_critical to revenue generation —_
_manufacturing, finance and in-_
_surance, and information and_
_communication technology, “as_
_this will accelerate the fiscal con-_
_solidation process.”_
_The persistent rise in the fiscal_
_deficit has been linked to rapid_
_public debt accumulation._
_The budget experts project that_
_the overall fiscal deficit will per-_
_sist due to infrastructure-relat-_
_ed expenditure pressures, the in-_
_crease in debt servicing expendi-_
_tures alongside other critical ex-_
_penditures such as the economic_
_stimulus programme and imple-_
_mentation of a new manifesto by_
_the new administration._
_“This is expected to play a great-_
_er role in the stickiness of the fis-_
_cal deficit over the medium term._
_Thus the public debt stock is like-_
_ly to increase even further in the_
_coming years.”_
_But even as this happens, PBO_
_says that fiscal discipline and_



_commitment to efficient imple-_
_mentation of the budget by both_
_national and sub-national enti-_
_ties could lead to higher econom-_
_ic growth, thereby increasing rev-_
_enue and reducing the need to_
_borrow._
_The experts say that controlling_
_debt service will require restruc-_
_turing of domestic debt and that_
_debt service, which is a manda-_
_tory expense, is estimated to ac-_
_count for over 60 per cent of or-_
_dinary revenue, thereby reducing_
_resources available for other “crit-_
_ical expenditures”._
_Domestic debt service accounts_
_for 74 per cent of total public debt_
_service even though it accounts_
_for only 48 per cent of total debt_
_stock._
_While external debt accounts_
_for 52 per cent of total debt stock,_
_it accounts for only 26 per cent of_
_debt service._
_This implies that domestic debt_
_restructuring will have a great-_
_er impact on alleviating the_
_debt-service burden._

he Kenya Railways Corporation
(KRC) and the National Land
〇〇〇

in a vicious battle over Sh17 billion
meant for compensating land owners in
the Nairobi-Naivasha Standard Gauge
Railway project.
The corporation, which accuses
the commission — chaired by Dr
Muhammad Swazuri — of delaying
the payments due to landowners on
Phase 2A of the multi-billion-shilling
SGR project, has now moved to court
to compel NLC to pay.
The State corporation says in court
documents that NLC had prepared all
the compensation schedules, which
comprised properties to be acquired
within the sections of the corridor
from Nairobi National Park to Ongata
Rongai station and sections within
Ongata Rongai, Ngong and Mai Mahiu
station area.


**Levy fund**
Soon after, the Railway Development Levy Fund Advisory Committee
approved the compensation schedule
for the sum of Sh7,520,925,616.03,
which NLC was expected to pay out.
Further approvals were done and money
released in the months of October last
year to January this year.
“As a consequence of the foregoing,
the Railway Development Levy Fund
Advisory Committee approved disbursements of funds to the National
Land Commission amounting to
Sh10,224,478,162.46,” the corporation

says.
“The National Treasury has so far
released to the National Land Commission compensation funds for Phase
2A of the SGR Project amounting to
Sh17,745,404,728.46 … it’s the legitimate expectation of all concerned
and affected parties that NLC would
release the compensation funds received from the National Treasury to
the Projected Affected Persons (PAPs)
promptly and without any unnecessary



delays. Further, the said amounts were
released after due diligence had been
undertaken by several agencies and the
same approved by the Kenya Railways
and the Railway Development Levy
Fund Advisory Committee.”
Kenya Railways goes on to state
that PAPs had the right to withhold
their respective parcels of land until
they have been paid land but, in the
present case, Kenya Railways took possession of their parcels of land within
the corridor for Phase 2 A of the SGR
Project and construction work has been
ongoing due to the strict timelines for
the project.
“The construction work for Phase 2
A of the SGR Project has been suffering
delays caused by frustrated PAPs who
have not been compensated for their
respective portions of land that has
been acquired for the project.
Kenya Railways has written to NLC
directly and made demands through
its advocates seeking the release of the
compensation funds due and payable
to the PAPs and which sums have been
received from the National Treasury
but the NLC continues to withhold a
substantial part of the sum and failed
to respond appropriately, without any
justification at all to the detriment of the



Kenya Railways,” states Kenya Railways.
It adds that frustration on the ongoing construction work on Phase 2 A of
the SGR Project is likely to occasion
delays to the completion deadline of
May 31, 2019 hence the urgency of
this matter.
“There have been wrangles within
the National Land Commission, which
have necessitated filing of a suit at the
High Court in Nairobi. However, such
disputes should not interfere with the
rights of the PAPs which are guaranteed by the Constitution or cause huge
losses to the Kenya Railways arising
from potential court cases or claims
for damages due to the aforestated
delays,” it stated.
Previously, the commission said the
valuation was grossly exaggerated and
needs to be reviewed and scaled down.
In November last year, NLC ViceChairperson Abigael Mbagaya placed
a Gazette notice on behalf of the commission, effectively cancelling the initial
valuation issued by NLC in March.
In the new notice, Ms Mbagaya noted
that the commission cancelled the Sh17
billion award as a result of discrepancies
in computations, omissions and errors
in areas that were to be acquired.


**Size of land**
She also said there were changes in
thre sizes of land acquired as a result of
project realignment, resulting in some
of the remaining portions of land being
both uneconomical and inaccessible.
The commission further argued that
some major developments were partially
affected, creating the need to acquire
them as a whole.
She also stated that other parcels
of land were severely affected by the
project by either splitting them into
non-useful and uneconomical portions.
NLC said there were overlapping of
boundaries, welcoming those affected
to seek clarifications.
The decision led to delays in payment
despite the National Treasury having
released the Sh17 billion compensation.
The suit by Kenya Railways does not
mention the November 2, 2018 Gazette
notice that called for re-valuation.
In a separate interview with Ms
Mbagaya, she had stated that the
commission had by Thursday last week
already paid Sh12.2 billion after the
evaluation was redone.
She said only a few owners with disputes, succession cases and court cases
had not been compensated.
Ms Mbagaya told the _Sunday Nation_



that individuals whose land was affected
showed up at the commission and were
satisfied with the new valuations. Mbagaya was non-committal on the amounts
saved but a source not authorised to
speak to the press said it is between
Sh7-8.5 billion.
“The government had issues with
the valuation and we relooked it in
consultation with all stakeholders which
include Ministry of Lands, Ministry of
Infrastructure and Kenya Railways. It
was discovered there were gross exaggerations in some cases arising from
the errors attributed to in the Gazette
notice,” she said.
She said most of those affected have
already agreed with the new awards.





It is a stand KRC appears not to agree
with, prompting the legal action. On
December 31, 2018, acting Managing
Director of Kenya Railways Philip
Mainga expressed concern over the
slow pace of compensation.
“Considering there has been a twoyear delay in acquisition of the land,
this is now causing further delays in
implementing the project which, as
you are aware, has a completion date
of June 2019. The corporation is also
concerned the wrangles and confusion
at the commission are contributing to
the delay in releasing of the funds. This
is going to affect the project negatively,”
noted Mr Mainga. He had noted that

The National Land Commission
members’ term comes to an end mid
next month after six years at the helm.
The commission, of late, has been a
theatre of supremacy wars pitying the
embattled chairman Muhamad Swazuri
and his deputy Ms Abigael Mbagaya.
When it was introduced as part of
reforms envisaged under the 2010
constitution, the National Land Commission’s purpose was to correct a scar
on the conscience of the nation: the
land question.
The jury is still out on the commission’s performance especially in land
compensations, but come February 19,
the current commissions will have finished their tour of duty. Shortly after the



commission winds up, a selection panel
will be constituted by the President.
The panel shall consist of a nominee of the Office of the President;
representative of the Cabinet Secretary, two persons, of opposite gender
nominated by the Non-Governmental
Organisations Council and one person
who is a citizen of Kenya, nominated
by the Kenya Private Sector. There will
also be a nominee of the Association
of Professional Societies in East Africa
and a nominee of the National Gender
and Equality Commission.
According to NLC Act the Public
Service Commission shall convene the
first meeting of the selection panel, at
which the members of the selection
panel shall elect a chairperson from
among their number.
The process shall then advertise
and shortlist qualified candidates,



conduct interviews and finally the selection panel will forward names of the
shortlisted candidates to the President
who will then present the names to the
National Assembly for approval.
The whole process will take not less
than three months.
All the commissioners will be replaced. Apart from Dr Swazuri and Ms
Mbagaya, the rest of the commissioners
are Abdulkadir Khalif, Clement Lenachuru, Emma Muthoni Njogu, Dr Rose
Musyoka, Dr Samuel Tororei, Silas
Muriithi and Dr Tomiik Mboya.
According to Ms Mbagaya, some
of the major achievements of the
commission include the growth of the
commission into an institution which
has offices in all the 47 counties.
“Of course devolution becomes another key achievement. Kenyans can
reach us in every county headquarters



in the republic. You will note that during
the last elections, the land question was
not an issue any more. It was peaceful.
This is because the devolved units
address land issues and disputes efficiently, defusing any tensions,” she says.
The commission has been offering
legislative guidance by aligning all land
laws to the Constitution.
“We did participate in development of
regulations and guidelines for the Land
Act 2012, Land Registration Act 2012,
Development of the Community Land
Act and Regulations under National
Land Commission Act among others.
These were key to operationalising the
new laws and for the implementation of
land reform agenda,” she said.
She added that the commission
developed Public Land Information
Management System, which led to
digitisation of public land.



“We are busy collating data on public
land in Kenya and inputting into the
system. We have information from
45 counties and from State agencies
also who hold land in trust for Kenyans. These include schools, which
are now being titled. We have titled
approximately 11,700 parcels out of
about 32,600 schools and the process
is ongoing,” she said.
Ms Mbagaya said the commission
has been able to recover grabbed public
lands including forests, road reserves,
schools, waterways, continental shelves,
riparian lands, sensitive ecosysytems
like Lake Olbolosat in Oljororok, the
Lamu sand dunes, and military landamong others."

hard a number of speculators who had
bought property worth billions of shillings
along the route eyeing compensation from
the government.
A wave of excitement had been spreading
in areas where the line was expected to cross
on its way to Kisumu after completion of the
Nairobi-Naivasha phase expected in August,
with land prices steadily shooting up.
The uncertainty over the building of SGR
will also be a big blow to strategic businesses
that had planned with the Narok-Bomet
-Kisumu route after Transport Cabinet Secretary James Macharia on Fridaay announced
Sh40 billion would be spent to rehabilitate
the Metre Gauge Railway instead.
It is not clear how long the SGR project
will take to resume — if at all, given the huge
investment in rehabilitating the old line —
but most of those who bought land along
the route had anticipated quick returns.
Yesterday, State House indicated there were
no loan negotiations in Beijing but did say
when these would continue.
In the ongoing Nairobi-Naivasha phase of
the construction, the amount given out in
way leave compensation was at least Sh10.2
billion, giving huge expectations to land
buyers and residents on the Naivasha-Kisumu stretch.
One of the targeted areas is Bomet. In



February 2018, a contingent of government
officials travelled from Nairobi to Bomet to
inform Governor Joyce Laboso and residents that a substation of the SGR would be
constructed near the county headquarters.
The team — which comprised National
Land Commission (NLC) officials, Kenya
Railways surveyors and representatives of
the Chinese company building the SGR —
said there would be compensation for those
who surrendered land.
Mr Samwel Totorei, a commissioner of
the NLC whose term expired early this year,
was part of the team.
“Do not be cheated by cartels and land
speculators to surrender your land. Instead
deal directly with government institutions
on the matter,” he said.
The team’s revelation created a wave of
excitement that is replicated in parts of
Narok County where the Nairobi-Naivasha
phase of the SGR has touched.
As a result of the project, the value of
land has tripled in Mai Mahiu, Suswa and
Satellite area where a proposed industrial
park feeding on the railway will be located.
Due to the construction of the new railway, a 50-by-100 feet plot that used to fetch



Sh300,000 in Suswa two years ago is now
selling at Sh1.5 million.
Many of those who bought land in Suswa
are outsiders from Nairobi, Kisii, Naivasha,
Nakuru among other areas.
Mr Joseph Kamau bought two acres of
land next to Suswa town and thought it
was a sure hit especially if the SGR would
be extended through Narok to Bomet and
Sotik then finally to Kisumu.
Speaking to the S _unday Nation_ on phone,
Mr Kamau said he bought the land for Sh3
million last year. He is now staring at a loss
because the land is not on the most prime.
“I was convinced to buy land in Suswa
because of the 120 kilometre Nairobi-Naivasha line which I hear costs Sh150 billion. I
believed I would set up a business near the
SGR phase 2A Terminus in Suswa. But it
seems I was hoodwinked,” he added.
Another land buyer, Mr Samson Momanyi,
said the blueprints that were made available
by government officials left no doubt that
there would be a mega impact of the SGR
because of a container depot.
“I was attracted by the dry port in Kedong



Ranch that partly touches Suswa Centre. I
thought maybe once the project is completed,
Suswa will grow big because most containers
will be picked there. I had a plan to put up a
hotel — the cheap hotels for truck drivers —
or build some average housing units to serve
the workforce who will be there,” he added.
He thus bought the land for about Sh2.5
million per acre in the outskirts of the centre.
Narok East MP Lemanken Aramat said
the craze of buying rural land at exorbitant
prices in a bid to cash in on some “hoax”
projects has left many families in misery.
The Jubilee legislator decried uncontrolled
sale of land along the SGR corridor, warning
that it was a time bomb waiting to explode
for locals.
“We are now seeing a lot of advertisements
in the media for plots in Suwa and Duka
Moja. The land there has turned prime because of the SGR and we will not allow this
to happen,” said Mr Aramat.
The MP asked the land speculators to
spend their money elsewhere.
On their part, residents of Suswa who
spoke with the Sunday Nation said they were

Ever since the construction of
the standard gauge railway began in
Mombasa in October 2013, the project
has been dogged by one scandal after
another.
First was its astronomical cost. The
470-kilometre section from Mombasa
to Nairobi cost Sh327 billion while the
150km section that runs from Nairobi
to Naivasha cost Sh150 billion.
During his trip to China this week,
President Uhuru Kenyatta and his delegation were expected to announce at
least Sh360 billion had been secured
for the Naivasha-Kisumu phase.
Instead, Transport and Infrastructure
Cabinet Secretary James Macharia said
priority is to rehabilitate the old railway
line at Sh40 billion.
Some previous recommendations
before construction of the SGR began
were for the rehabilitation of the old
railway at a fraction of the amount
projected for a new one.
However, the government dismissed



the proposals, with China Road and
Bridge Corporation winning the award
to implement the expensive Beijing-funded project.
But even then, more questions were
raised on the cost.
“We negotiated and awarded the
tender for Sh227 billion when we were
leaving office,” said Orange Democratic
Movement leader Raila Odinga, who
added that the project was conceived
during the grand coalition government
in which he was prime mister from
2008 to 2013.
“What Jubilee only did was to retender it to the same contractor but at
an inflated price of Sh350 billion. It is
the cost that we have a problem with,”
Mr Odinga said in 2014.
This week, Mr Odinga was part of
the government's delegation in Beijing.
Perhaps the biggest problem with
SGR is that it appears to be a vendor-driven project.
Instructively, a well-known influence-peddler acted as a middleman
before being edged out when Jubilee
took power in 2013.



Once again, the government bitterly
defended itself over the inflated cost of
the SGR, accusing the opposition of
demonising and attempting to sabotage
a well-intentioned project.
President Kenyatta swore that nothing would come in the way of his pet
project whose cost was considerably
higher compared to others in countries
like Ethiopia.
Kenyans were even more surprised
when they saw diesel-powered locomotives being unloaded at Mombasa
port instead of the high-speed trains
they had been promised.
In 2017, Mr Macharia said the government would spend Sh65 billion to
electrify the line by 2021.
“We are not sure of the power supply,”
he said to justify the option of the diesel
locomotives.
Even with the billions of shillings
sank into the project, Kenyans were
shocked last year to learn that they were
forking out Sh1 billion every month to
pay the Chinese firm to operate the line.
As expected, the government reacted
angrily to the report.



“The SGR is not a matatu. It it is a
huge operation and it costs billions to
run,"" Deputy President William Ruto
said.
According to experts, since Kenya is
primarily an import country, the SGR
would have made economic sense if
neighbouring countries mainly served
by Mombasa agreed to build similar
lines and linkede them to Kenya’s.
Cargo volumes are still woefully low
since no neighbouring countries have
committed or even secured funding for
their own projects.
This has pushed the government
to desperation. Last year, it forced
importers to use the SGR rather than
the road. The decision led to protests.
There were complaints about racist
and degrading treatment Kenyans working for the SGR were being subjected
to by the Chinese.
Once again, the government rushed
to defence of the project. Government
spokesman Eric Kiraithe spewed bile
and venom, blaming unnamed persons
of being detractors.
“While we’ll protect individual rights



and dignity of Kenyans, inward looking
'haki yetu' centred personalities have no
place in this kind of profession,” he said.
In November 2018, the Sunday
Nation exposed a complex ticketing syndicate involving officials of the Chinese
operators of the SGR and their Kenyan
accomplices through which millions of
shillings were lost.
Another suspect aspect of the SGR
has been the high cost of acquiring land
for the project. Former National Land
Commission chairman Muhammad
Swazuri and others were arraigned
days ago for settling false compensation claims.
A number of lopsided contracts have
dented the hopes of the SGR ever
making profit.
In March, the Sunday Nation revealed
ran a story showing Kenya Railways
Corporation intended to award a company linked to Mombasa Governmor
Ali Hassan Joho preferential rates to
transport bulk cargo on the SGR for
almost 30 years.
The offer letter to the Joho firm was
later withdrawn."

Special Correspondent


unding for the next phase of the
Standard Gauge Railway could be
〇〇〇

to impose trade sanctions on Kenya in
retaliation for a ban on Chinese fi sh.
Acting ambassador Li Xuhang described the ban as a “trade war”,
warning that his country could react
in the same way it did to US President
Donald Trump’s imposition of tariff s
on Chinese goods.
Mr Li was addressing a group, made
up of MPs, academics with links to
Chinese institutions and others, invited
for a familiarisation tour of the SGR at
the Chinese embassy in Nairobi yesterday morning. He revealed that the
embassy had a letter from the Fisheries
Department cancelling all applications
for imports of Chinese fi sh.
Imposition of the ban on Chinese fi sh
follows President Kenyatta’s remarks
recently when he publicly wondered
why imported fi sh should be fl ooding



the Kenyan market at the expense of
local produce, and challenged offi cials
to fi nd ways to curb the infl ux.
At stake will be funding for the Naivasha-Kisumu phase of the SGR, which
has already been delayed after China
refused to sign an agreement during
President Kenyatta’s visit to the Forum
for China-Africa Cooperation in Beijing
last month.
China refused to sign the funding deal
to express displeasure at what it views
as an increasingly hostile operating
environment, citing negative media reports and public bashing by politicians.
President Kenyatta is also expected
to sign an agreement during a return
visit to China in early November that
would ease exportation of Kenyan food
and agricultural products to the vast
Chinese market.
The seasoned Kenyan palate rejects
the mass farmed Chinese tilapia whose
taste customers describe as “plastic”
and lacking in the deep aroma of lake
fi sh. The bones in the Chinese fi sh are
small which makes it diffi cult to eat.
But Kenyan pockets gravitate towards
the “plastic” fi sh: a kilo of Chinese fi sh
goes for about Sh230. Prime Kenyan
tilapia fi llet sells for Sh700 and a kilo
of whole fi sh is about Sh400.



On October 24, the acting director-general of the Kenya Fisheries
Service Susan Imende wrote to fi sh
importers: “This is to notify you that all
fi sh import applications for oreochomis
niloticus Tilapia will not be approved
in the country with eff ect from January
1, 2019.”
The grace period, she explained,
would allow importers to clear existing
orders.
Although the letter was not specifi c
to Chinese fi sh, it is instructive that
it covered only tilapia, a species only
China exports to Kenya in appreciable
quantities.
It is also notable that the letter came
only 10 days after President Kenyatta
spoke about Chinese fish imports.
Speaking at the SMEs conference at
Strathmore University, the President
lamented that the imported fi sh was
strangling local fi shermen. Although
he did not pronounce a ban, he urged
offi cials to fi nd creative ways around
the legal provisions, such as citing
heath concerns.
The letter from Fisheries did not
give any reasons, but it clearly irked
the Chinese government.
Mr Li said yesterday that the main
concern was not so much the volume of



business to be aff ected, but the principle
of free trade, the rule of law, adherence
to bilateral trade agreements and WTO
rules and due process.
Economic and Commercial Counsellor Dr Guo Ce said he was shocked
by Kenya’s action, adding that within
a short time the contents of the letter
would be all over the media in China
which would aff ect relations between
the two countries.



A woman carries a box of Chinese fi sh in Kisumu on October 17. Fishmongers in the
town protested the President’s directive to ban the imports.



The ambassador noted that the ban
comes just before President Kenyatta
travels to Shanghai for the China International Import Expo, where Kenya will
be one of the main African countries
showcasing her produce for the Chinese market.
During the Expo President Kenyatta
is expected to meet with his Chinese
counterpart. The two countries are
also expected to sign an agreement on
Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures
that would open the door for Kenyan
fruits, beef, lamb, vegetables and other
foodstuff into the Chinese market.
The briefi ng at the Chinese embassy
before the SGS tour was attended by
Ambassador Chris Chika, director of
the Asia Pacifi c Desk at the Ministry
of Foreign Aff airs, and Kisumu East
MP Shakeel Shabbir who headed the
team of MPs from the Kenya-China
Parliamentary Group.
Reacting to the sentiments of the Chinese ambassador, Mathira MP Rigathi
Gachagua, who has proposed a Bill to
cap the value of contracts awarded to
foreigners to Sh1bn and above, accused
the Chinese of blackmail and asked the
government to call their bluff ."

he chickens have come
home to roost for some of
〇〇〇

country after what started off as
an investigation into leased extra
storage space for containers by
Kenya Ports Authority exposed
an intricate web of powerful
business and political dynasties.
Two companies — Mitchell
Cotts and Nairobi Inland Container Terminal (NICT) — at the
centre of investigations on the
Inland Container Depot (ICD)
scandal, have tight links with the
Moi, Ndegwa, Saitoti, Kulei and
Nyachae family empires.
Already, Baringo Senator
Gideon Moi, NCBA banker
James Philip Maina Ndegwa,
a number of KRA offi cials and
directors of the companies
have been to the Directorate of
Criminal Investigations (DCI)
to shed light on the matter.
The _Nation_ tried to contact
Mr Moi yesterday, but his aide
asked for the questions we
wanted to ask the Senator. After
sending the queries, a senior
Kanu offi cial called back and
said: “Moi was nowhere near
Thika Road. He was not summoned and was not questioned.
I was with him from 9am in the
morning and I can tell you for a
fact he was not there. And anyway he is not linked to Mitchell
Cotts after all.”
Since last week, detectives
have been questioning offi cials
from Kenya Ports Authority and
the Kenya Revenue Authority
in order to understand how the
tender that is linked to perennial
delays of cargo clearance at the
Inland Container Depot (ICD)
in Nairobi was awarded.
Mitchell Cotts and Nairobi
Inland Container Terminal were
last year controversially awarded
a tender to provide leasing facilities to KPA due to congestion
at the ICD in Nairobi.


**Traffi c shot up**
The congestion was created
after the government realised
that the Standard Gauge Railway
(SGR) freight service was not
doing well and made a decision
that forced all inland cargo to be
cleared in Nairobi.
As a result, container traffi c on
the SGR shot up by four times,
with the ICD receiving up to
seven trains of cargo every day
from just one when the freight
service was launched in December 2017.
But there was one problem
— the ICD could only handle
15,000 TEUs, and this led to
clearance delays.
To calm the nerves of the
big transporters who lost business after the SGR launched

_Khelef Khalifa and Ms Wanjiru_
_Gikonyo sought to have all con-_
_tracts, agreements and studies re-_
_lated to the construction and op-_
_erations of the SGR made pub-_

_documents confi dential violates_
_the law and discourages trans-_
_parency in governance._
_In May, Justice John Mativo_
_ruled that public offi cers have a_
_constitutional duty to make in-_
_formation available to Kenyans_
_saying that any restriction on ac-_
_cess to information from the gov-_

_“It is clear that the respond-_

_provisions of sections 3(6) & (7)_
_of the Offi cial Secrets Act fl ies in_
_the face of Article 35, section 29_
_of the Access to Information Act_
_and falls to be rejected,” ruled Jus-_
_tice Mativo._
_The judge argued that there are_
_no two systems of law regulat-_
_ing access to information held by_
_public bodies._


**Most expensive projects**
_Mr Khelefa and Ms Gikonyo_
_had, in the case, argued that doc-_
_uments related to the SGR pro-_
_ject and its fi nancing have never_
_been made public despite being_
_one of the most expensive pro-_
_jects undertaken by the govern-_
_ment._
_“SGR is the largest capital-in-_
_tensive infrastructure project_
_ever constructed in the coun-_
_try, but despite this extraordi-_
_nary expenditure of public funds,_
_the project has been undertak-_
_en with controversy and secrecy_
_from its inception,” they argued._



_lished “to be applied in priority to_
_make repayment of loans in rela-_
_tion to the project”._
_The contract also demanded_
_that Kenya fi rst approaches Chi-_
_na to purchase any goods from_
_the proceeds of SGR, before going_
_to any other market._
_The deal, which was signed by_
_former Treasury Cabinet Secre-_
_tary Henry Rotich and Li Ruogu,_
_the President of the Export and_
_Import (Exim) Bank of China, al-_
_so precludes Kenya from sharing_
_its details._
_“The Borrower shall keep all the_
_terms and conditions hereunder_

_out the prior written consent of_
_the Lender, the Borrower shall_
_not disclose any information_
_hereunder or in connection with_
_this Agreement to any third par-_
_ty unless required by applicable_
_law,” the deal reads._
_During his vetting in Parlia-_
_ment, Mr Murkomen had prom-_
_ised to make the SGR contract_
_public, saying Kenyans had the_
_right to know what the govern-_
_ment signed on their behalf._


**‘Never seen’**

_“I have spoken to everybody_
_whom I thought was a person_
_of infl uence in government and_
_privy to the SGR contract but_
_they have said they have never_
_seen the SGR agreement. I don’t_
_want to name those I spoke to,_
_but once I get into the offi ce, I will_
_look for it,” Mr Murkomen said._
_Following exclusive reporting_
_by the Nation on the SGR con-_
_tract in 2020, especially on the_
_collateral Kenya put up, the Chi-_
_nese Foreign Ministry Spokes-_
_person Hua Chunying said: “We_
_have checked with the relevant_



Mr Kipchumba Murkomen


_found that the allegation that_
_Kenyan side used the Mombasa_
_Port as a collateral in its payment_
_agreement with the Chinese fi-_
_nancial institution for the Mom-_
_basa-Nairobi Railway is not true.”_
_Since President Kenyatta prom-_
_ised on live television to make_
_public the SGR contract in 2019,_
_the government has been play-_
_ing hide and seek with Kenyans_
_on the matter, with the coun-_
_try lef in the dark on just what_
_it signed and what the Chinese_
_were guaranteed in the process._
_In January this year, the govern-_
_ment, following a court order, cit-_
_ed a non-disclosure agreement_
_with the Chinese lenders for its_
_refusal to make the contract pub-_
_lic. It argued that the contract_
_contains non-disclosure clauses_
_and its release would endanger_
_national security and injure rela-_
_tions with China._
_Then Transport Principal Sec-_
_retary Dr Joseph Njoroge said_
_in January 2022 court docu-_
_ments that agreements entered_
_between Kenya and Chinese_
_contractors over the construc-_
_tion of the SGR have non-disclo-_



_ya was to repay the amount in_
_156 months (13 years), and was_
_to dedicate 42.06 per cent of the_
_proceeds from the railway to re-_
_pay the loan._
_The contract also confi rms fears_
_that Kenya had been bound to_
_seek resolution—in case of a dis-_
_pute—only in China, which ex-_
_perts have said gives the Asian_
_nation a big advantage._
_“If no settlement is reached_
_through friendly consultation,_
_each party shall have a right to_
_submit a dispute to the China In-_
_ternational Economic and Trade_
_Arbitration Committee for arbi-_

enya signed a secret
agreement with the Chi## K nese, allowing a mystery

company with unknown local
shareholders to run the Standard
Gauge Railway, documents seen
by the _Sunday Nation_ show.
Publicly, China Road and
Bridge Corporation (CRBC), a
State-owned Chinese company
with Kenyan offices, will run the
trains for 10 years, but a “special
purpose operating company” was
formed in May 2017 to run the
operations.
The company, Africa Star Railway Operation Company Ltd, is
majority-owned by CRBC, but
the other shareholders remain a
mystery with details unavailable
at the Registrar of Companies
in Nairobi.
And it’s a lucrative, lopsided
deal for the operator. Last month,
the operator sent Kenya Railways
a fee note of Sh30 billion, which
it claims are pending payments.
Sh800 million out of it is made
up of penalties for late payments,
according to papers seen by the
_Sunday Nation_ .
The contract frees the operator
of all liabilities and forces Kenya
Railways to pay a fixed monthly
service charge – which must be
paid quarterly and in advance,
the documents show.
Before the operations started,
documents show, Kenya was
compelled to lend the operator
an interest free Sh3.5 billion,
according to the documents. A
special reserve account was also
set up to be maintained with Sh3
billion to cushion the operator.
The contract also put punitive
clauses pushing Kenya to start
operating the railway by June 1,
2017. Any delay in starting the
line would attract a fine of Sh24.2
million a day, the contract shows.
In the first six months of
operation, the operator was to
earn Sh13.3 billion for the passenger service trains, even as
the service was being marketed
and travellers yet to get familiar
with it. The fixed service monthly
payment is for running two pairs
of passenger trains, one pair of
cargo trains and another pair of
empty container trains between
Nairobi and Mombasa. If more
trains come into service, the cost
goes up, the contract shows.
“KR (Kenya Railways) acknowledges that the Operator
intends to create, no later than
twelve (12) months after the
execution date, a special purpose
operating company incorporated
under the laws of Kenya to act
as the operator under this agreement,” says the contract.
While the _Sunday Nation_
has seen the SGR operations
and maintenance deal signed
between CRBC and Kenya



Railways Corporation (KRC),
a separate document detailing
the operations allowing Africa
Star to take over the operations
is said to have been taken away
by lawyers.
Sources at the Transport
ministry, who asked not to be
named for fear of retribution,
said the secret contract was
signed at White Sands Hotel
in Mombasa in the presence of
a handful of officials hours before President Uhuru Kenyatta
launched the Madaraka Express
Mombasa-Nairobi train on May
31, 2017. KRC was represented by
Mr Atanas Maina, who has since
been suspended over corruption
charges.
The contract stops KRC from
publishing any information
provided to it by the operator,
and indicates that a copy has
to be submitted to CRBC for
approval — except in circumstances where such publication
is required by law.
“KR and the operator shall
keep confidential and shall
not disclose to any third party
any documents, data, or other
information furnished directly
by the other party hereto in connection with the Agreement or
in connection with the business
or commercial operations of the
parties whether such information
has been furnished prior to, during or following completion or
termination of the agreement,”
reads Clause 39 of the contract.
The secrecy is legally bound to
be kept even after the agreement
expires.
The _Sunday Nation_ contacted
both Kenya Railways and the
Transport ministry for responses
to questions on the contract
and to give officials a chance
to explain what is essentially a
complex document governing the
most expensive infrastructure
project in the country’s history.


**Non responsive**
Transport Cabinet Secretary
James Macharia, contacted on
Thursday, referred the _Sunday_
_Nation_ to the contracting parties – Kenyan Railways and the
Chinese. KRC and CRBC were
unresponsive despite several
e-mail and phone reminders. Efforts to get a comment from the
ministry and the two agencies
will continue after the publication
of this report.
One of those lingering questions is why a new company
was required to operate the
SGR while the CRBC, which
signed the deal, already has a
local branch.
Africa Star did not respond
to our queries over its role and
ownership even as records search
yielded nothing.
The operations and maintenance contract is the latest secret
SGR document to be revealed by
the _Sunday Nation_ following our
expose on the Mombasa-Nairobi
line loan agreement that, among
other things, waived Kenya’s
sovereignty over strategic assets
upon failure to service the more
than Sh400 billion debt.

elayed payment for land,
which stalled completion of
〇〇〇

the standard gauge railway (SGR),
could be costing the taxpayer Sh21
million per day, according to documents seen by the _Nation_ .
A letter by the chief executive
offi cer of the National Land Commission (NLC) to the CEO of the
Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) says the cash,
which amounts to nearly Sh3 billion
for the stand-off period, was being
accrued as payment to the railway’s
contractor for idle capacity and
non-accessibility to the site.
However, Transport and Infrastructure Cabinet Secretary James
Macharia yesterday said the payment clause would only apply if
the stipulated construction period
lapsed. He added that his ministry
had sought the help of the Ministry
of Interior to clear the SGR corridor
in a bid to avoid the extra costs
being accrued due to the stalemate.


**Through fi ve counties**
The contractor, China Communications Construction Company
(CCCC), stopped work on the
120-kilometre railway line in Empaash, Tuala, Oloosirkon, Milimani,
Rankau, Kandisi, Merisho, Nkoroi,
Kangawa, Oloolua, Ngong, Kimuka

bounced from offi ce to offi ce until
she confi rmed from the anti-graft
watchdog that her land was not
among those under probe.
After living on her quarter of an
acre plot for 17 years, she watched
as her home, two greenhouses and
livestock sheds were torn down
despite not receiving a cent in
compensation.
Communication between the
NLC and EACC indicates that the
Sh21 million-a-day payment had
been in operation for a while and
could have sparked Kenya Railways’
move to forcefully occupy land in
Nkoroi two weeks ago.
NLC acting CEO Kabale Tache
Arero wrote to the EACC chief, Mr
Twalib Mbarak, on June 19, fi ve
days after the demolitions, seeking
to prioritise compensation packages for Nkoroi residents.


**Spirit of cooperation**
NLC wants EACC to reveal the
status of investigations into land
parcels whose prices the anti-graft


〇〇〇

and Suswa following disputes on
paying owners for their land.
Under the contract, phase 2A was
to cost taxpayers Sh1.25 billion for
each kilometre of the railway line
that snakes through fi ve counties
— Nairobi, Kiambu, Kajiado, Narok
and Nakuru. But the accrued payments for idle capacity would infl ate
the total building cost.
Landowners in Nkoroi had
claimed Sh4.2 billion before the
Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission froze payment last year to
probe the infl ation of some parcels,
a scheme the anti-graft watchdog
believes was masterminded by NLC
and Kenya Railways offi cials.
Delayed compensation of
landowners set the stage for an
inter-agency battle in January when
the Kenya Railways Corporation,
the contracting state agency, sued
the NLC for stalling the process
and, in turn, delaying construction.
Some Nkoroi residents told the
_Nation_ last week that they had not
been paid despite confi rming from
the EACC that their land was not
under any investigation.

demolished on June 14, said she was

started in January, 2018. Compensation slowed down after EACC
opened an inquiry into hundreds
of suspicious claims.
EACC believes the infl ation was
for lining the pockets of a few NLC
and Kenya Railways offi cials.
Yesterday, CCCC issued a statement explaining it had been given
54 months from January last year to
complete the construction, meaning
that as at now, they are within a 36
month deadline for completing the
construction work.
Kenya Railways MD Philip
Mainga declined to comment as the
delays are linked to compensation
of land owners, which is still under
investigation by the EACC.
〇〇〇


Former NLC head Muhammad
Swazuri and his KR counterpart
Atanas Maina have been charged
with some of their juniors for allegedly infl ating land prices for phase
one of the line to defraud taxpay##### f


ers of Sh221 million. EACC froze
payment of compensation awards
to allow it to probe the infl ations.


〇〇〇

watchdog believes were infl ated.
“In the spirit of cooperation and
exchange of information and to
help NLC unlock compensation
for parcels that had been sampled
for investigations, the commission hereby requests that it be
assisted with the outcome of the
investigations or confi rmation of
the status of the same further to
preliminary fi ndings conveyed to
it. The NLC further requests for a
joint sitting between its valuation
working group and EACC valuers
to exchange information on the
identifi ed parcels,” the letter reads.
There are 136 days between January 28 when the court battle went
public, and June 14 when the government forcefully took possession
of land in Nkoroi, Kajiado County.
This means that, in that period, the
Chinese fi rm could have earned
Sh2.8 billion for idle capacity.
Phase one of the SGR line started
passenger services on June 1, 2017
after a Sh323 billion cost for the

_ver time, every capitalist economy_
_goes through cycles that have peri-_
_ods of growth and periods of eco-_
_nomic contraction or recessions._
_These cycles continue, however, the_
〇〇〇
_erally upward. The global economy has_
_seen tremendous growth over the last_
_hundred years, albeit, through the experi-_
_ence of booms and busts._
_In most of the 19th and 20th centuries_
_during the explosion of capitalistic econo-_
_mies, laissez-faire economics ruled the day_
_with little government intervention in the_
_economy, with some minor tweaks dur-_
_ing the progressive era in terms of break-_
_ing up monopolies, other than that the_
_government stayed fairly hands off. The_
_great depression in 1929 however changed_
_everything. All of a sudden the leading_
_global economies at the time were seeing_
_at least 25% unemployment and the tradi-_
_tional way of economic thinking was not_
_able to solve the problems of the day._
_Economist John Maynard Keynes often_
_regarded as the father of modern mac-_
_roeconomics focused on theories affect-_
_ing employment, interest and money. All_
_these are relevant today as the world is_
_battling the effects of the global econom-_
_ic downturn brought on by Covid-19 pan-_
_demic, Russia-Ukraine war, geopolitics,_
_food shortages and rising fuel prices._
_When we think about Keynesian eco-_
_nomics let us think about what actual-_
_ly drives a capitalist economy. One of the_
_most important factors that keeps an_
_economy afloat is if people have money_
_and spend that money on necessities and_
_other purchases. People are buying goods_
_and services, thereby allowing business-_
_es to grow and economies to prosper. With_
_high rates of unemployment, spending_
_in the economy gets negatively impacted._
_For free-market economics to work people_
_need to be spending as they are driving de-_
_mand which businesses supply, leading to_
_further employment, expansion, profita-_
_bility, and prosperity. This is only possible_
_with employment. Keynes devised the eco-_
_nomic theory that government should ac-_
_tually spend money during recessions in_
_order to put money back in people's pock-_
_ets._
_In Kenya we are witnessing many me-_
_ga-projects in progress. The country is_
_geared towards vision 2030. Additional-_



_Shillings. What is required most is the care-_

‘We have _ful prioritising of the right projects due_
witnessed _to the limited resources available as well_

_as accountability. We have witnessed the_

the problems _problems faced by nations burdened with_
faced by _international debt and the compound-_

_ing effect of inflation and unemployment_

nations

_in Sri Lanka, Lebanon, Mexico and many_

burdened with _such nations._
international _Today, Keynesian economics is still very_

_much alive when recessions happen, one_

debt and the _of the major economic trends is for the_
compounding _government to spend money in order to lessen the blow of those recessions. This_
effect of _remains controversial, because again, con-_
inflation and _ventional thinking also goes along the_

_lines that maybe the government should_

unemployment _not be spending money during a recession_
in Sri Lanka, _because there is no money to spend. Dur-_
Lebanon, _ing smaller recessions maybe the econo-my may not need the government going_
Mexico and _into further debt. There is constant debate_
many such _about how much the government should_

_be involved in helping the economy recov-_

nations _er from the recession._

_Nobel prize-winning Keynesian eco-_
_nomic thinker Paul Krugman wrote about_
_Keynes that “now I am not saying that_
_Keynes was right about everything but the_
_essential truth of Keynes’ big idea that an_
_economy can fail if consumers and inves-_
_tors spend too little and that the pursuit_
〇〇〇
_of sound money and balanced budgets is_
_sometimes not always folly, is as evident in_
_today’s world as it was in the 1930s. And in_
_these dangerous days, we ignore or reject_
_that idea at the world economy’s peril.”_

_“the new deal” where, through massive_
_government spending, people could go_
_back to work and money would be circu-_
_lating through the economy again. Now_
_under the new deal, Roosevelt promised_
_these massive spending programs in or-_
_der to put people back to work and get_
_people spending money again. He did this_
_through new government agencies creat-_
_ed with the intention of generating em-_
_ployment. These included the National_
_Recovery Administration which tried to_
_get business and labor together to create_
_better working conditions for people and_
_higher wages and more opportunities for_
_employment through the private sector_
_using some government legislation._
_The Works Progress Administration was_
_a massive government spending plan_
_whereby billions of dollars were spent on_
_building the interstate system in the Unit-_
_ed States, building arts and culture infra-_
_structure, and building dams in the Ten-_

_droelectric power. All these policies dur-_
_ing the great depression were able to less-_

_ic effects on people, generate more jobs_
_and therefore get money circulating in the_

_economy._
_Ultimately, what brought the United_
_States out of the depression was its par-_

_all the spending that came along with it._
_In Kenya today, many projects are under-_

maintenance costs for the standard
gauge railway (SGR), according to a
copy of the agreement obtained by
the _Nation._
The deal signed between China Roads
and Bridges Corporation (CRBC) and
Kenya Railways (KR) on May 30, 2017
compels the latter to seek funding
from the Treasury should it fi nd itself
unable to pay maintenance bills for the
Mombasa-Nairobi line.
“In the event that KR is unable to
secure budget allocation from the Treasury for any of the periodic maintenance,
the operator shall have no obligation to
undertake periodic maintenance in the
relevant calendar year,” reads Clause
23.5.1 of the agreement.
The deal defi nes periodic maintenance to include rolling stock, track and
stations and whose budget is supposed
to be prepared one year in advance and
submitted to Kenya Railways.
The Chinese railway operator, which
built the line, is also allowed to only
maintain the line within the budget
the Treasury is able to foot through
taxpayers and leave the rest to the
detriment of the line, with the contract
only compelling them to disclose the
consequences to KR.
Already, CRBC has sent Kenya
Railways a bill of Sh31 billion, which remains unpaid as the railway operations
enter their second year. About Sh800
million is from accumulated penalties
for delayed payments, according to an
invoice seen by the _Nation._
Treasury Cabinet Secretary Henry
Rotich did not respond to queries regarding the taxpayer guarantee even
as other State offi cials remained tightlipped on the skewed deal exposed by
the _Nation_ on Sunday.
The operation and maintenance
contract introduces a new operating
company — partly owned by CRBC

billion. Its repayment starts in
January 2020. A special reserve
account was also set to be maintained with Sh3 billion as part
of the starting preconditions to
cushion the operator’s cash fl ow.
Under the confi dential con

〇〇〇

M-Pesa cash transfer platform.
Even sweeter for CRBC, the
operating company known as the
Africa Star Railway Operations
Company, which is registered in
Kenya, has been used to relieve
the Chinese operator from any
liabilities under the contract.
Even where some financial
culpability has been found on
CRBC, it cannot be more than 10
per cent of their quarterly fi xed
earnings, even if the losses are
from the operator’s fault. Furthermore, the operator was only
required to give a performance
bond of Sh600 million.
Kenya Railways also signed to
allow smooth processing of work
permits for Chinese nationals to
work in the running of the train,
including accepting Chinese
professional qualifi cations just
like Kenyan ones and facilitating
ease of moving train parts for
repair in China and importing
train parts into the country
without paying any tax.
The contract empowers
the Chinese operator with an
“non-exclusive licence to use,


〇〇〇

and undisclosed minority shareholders
— which has saddled Kenya Railways
with hard-to-meet operating expenses,
spelling doom for its profi tability and
threatening to turn SGR into Kenya’s
biggest white elephant.
Taxpayers are also supposed to start
paying the fi rst instalment of the Sh327
billion loan borrowed from the China
Exim bank in 2014 to build the railway
line from January 2020 after the expiry

of the fi ve-year grace period last
month.

A lawyer who was to be prosecuted alongside Deputy Chief
Justice Philomena Mwilu (right)
yesterday sought to have the
charges against him withdrawn.
Mr Stanley Muluvi Kiima
has sued the directors of public prosecutions and criminal
investigations, the Nairobi Anti-Corruption Court and the
Attorney-General.
Mr Kiima argues that when
High Court judges Hellen
Omondi, Mumbi Ngugi, William
Musyoka, Enock Chacha Mwita
and Francis Tuiyott quashed the
prosecution of the deputy chief
justice, they failed to issue a
conclusive determination about
the charges he is facing.
Mr Kiima was listed as an
interested party in the case.
He said the fi ve-judge bench
only indicated that even though
he had set out violations of his


〇〇〇


〇〇〇

rights, they could not issue
substantive orders to him at
the time.


**Violation of rights**
Mr Kiima argues that he is
now at risk of being arrested
and charged.
“There is nothing that prevents the [Drector of Public
Prosecutions] from continuing
with my prosecution before the


〇〇〇

Anti-Corruption Court,” Mr
Kiima said.
In documents fi led yesterday,
he argues his prosecution is
based on an illegality and constitutes a violation of his rights.


**Advocate-clients relationship**
On August 27 last year, police
raided the lawyer’s offi ce and
took away fi les and documents
relating to matters he was handling for Ms Mwilu.
The police informed him they
were investigating the DCJ but
they later had him arrested and
charged alongside Ms Mwilu.
Because the DCJ challenged
her prosecution, the trial issue
had been pending until May 31,
when the fi ve-judge bench declared that the evidence against
her was illegally obtained.
Mr Kiima further says his
prosecution arises from a
legitimate advocate-client relationship.

hen Nandi Hills MP
Alfred Keter emerged
〇〇〇

second floor of the Central Bank
of Kenya headquarters in Nairobi
yesterday mid-morning, he did little to hide the fact that his hands
were in handcuffs. However, he
wore his usual smile even as
television cameras rolled and
photographers clicked away.
The man who is not a stranger
to controversy looked unshaken.
On the ground floor later, as he
waited for a van to take him to
the Banking Fraud Investigations
Unit at Marshalls House, his expression changed and the smile
faded away.
He got a little agitated and
forced his way to the microphones,
when Mr Wallace Kantai, the head
of communications at the Central
Bank, stepped forward to tell
journalists why the outspoken
MP and two other men were in
handcuffs.
“These three individuals presented a set of forged Treasury
Bills which were purportedly
issued by the CBK a number of
years ago. The total amount is
Sh633 million,” Mr Kantai said.
Mr Keter was arrested alongside
Mr Arthur Ingolo Sakwa, and Mr
Madat Suburali Chatur. The CBK
said the three had presented the



identities of persons as well as assets and liabilities.”
Yesterday, Justice Mwita invalidated section 12 of the Act, which
provides for an acting Auditor-General in case of any vacancy due to
suspension, inability to perform
functions or pending appointment of a substantive one. The
Act empowered Public Service
Commission to recommend the
most senior officer in the office of
the Auditor-General to the President to designate such a person as
acting Auditor-General.
Justice Mwita ruled that the office
of Auditor General is independent
and should not be interfered with
by any legislative process that
would ground its mandate, which
is to ensure accountability of public
resources. He also declared as unconstitutional Section 42 of the Act,
which barred the Auditor-General
from questioning the merits of a
policy objective of the national or
county government or any other
public entity.
The judge also quashed section
27 of the Act, which established the
Audit Advisory Board that was to
advise the Auditor-General on the
exercise of his or her powers and
the performance of his or her functions. The board was established to
guide the Auditor-General on the
recruitment of senior managers,
review of organisational development issues, preparation of budget
estimates, remuneration and other
terms of appointment, which was to
be carried out in consultation with
the salaries commission.
In his ruling, Justice Mwita
said that the Office of the Auditor General was an independent
organ created in the Constitution
and Parliament cannot interfere
with its powers and functions.
He quashed sections 4(2) and 8
which had empowered the Public
Service Commission to supervise
the Auditor-General and delegate
to him or her power to develop a
human resources structure, including staff recruitment, promotion,
disciplinary matters, remuneration
and benefits in consultation with
the National Treasury.
“These sections were to curtail
powers rather than enhancing the
authority of the Auditor-General,”
he ruled.
However, he declined to declare
as unconstitutional several other
sections of the Act as had been
requested by the petitioner, Transparency International. He also
declined to find that Parliament
and President Uhuru Kenyatta
had violated the Constitution in
the run-up to creation of the Act.
He said both had acted within their

powers.

they waited for 28 years to cash in
T-Bills that matured 90 days after
they were bought in 1990.
Mr Keter’s arrest yesterday
adds to a growing list of troubles
that have befallen the MP in the
recent past.
Last month, the Jubilee Party
oversaw his removal as chairman
of the Labour and Social Welfare
Committee after President Uhuru
Kenyatta ordered MPs to vote him
out for going against the party.
But he protested the move, saying
it was meant to allow cartels to
thrive. He was ousted alongside
Moiben MP Silas Tiren at the
Agriculture Committee, Kangogo
Bowen (Marakwet East) at the Environment Committee and James
Gakuya (Embakasi North) at the
Broadcasting Committee.
In 2015, the outspoken MP, who
was once suspended at Egerton
University for leading a strike
against the administration, got
into trouble when he invoked
President Kenyatta’s name, after
he was caught on the wrong side
at the Gilgil weighbridge on the
Nairobi-Nakuru highway.
Mr Keter later accused the
Jubilee government of failing to
curb corruption in the standard
gauge railway contract.
Mr Keter last year was politically emboldened after he beat
a protégé of Deputy President
William Ruto to win the Jubilee
ticket for Nandi Hills.



90-day bills dated 1990.
Yesterday, the Chatur Group
of Companies said Mr Madat
Suburali Chatur was not related
to their chairman, Mr Madat
Saburali Chatur.
As Mr Kantai explained to
journalists why the MP was in
handcuffs, Mr Keter cut him short.
“Can I say something? I want to
say something,” he said as he
moved closer to the cameras.
Mr Kantai waved him off, but
the MP tried to push harder, then
gave up. However, as he was taken
into the waiting van together
with the two other individuals,
Mr Keter said he had committed
no crime. He claimed that he was



just caught up in the fiasco, and
that all he did was to take the two
men to CBK to complain about
unpaid T-Bills.
“I am not the one complaining. They were complaining and
I brought them to the CBK to
complain,” he said.
Sources at the bank said Mr
Keter had been frequenting there
to protest the non-payment of the
Bills before it was discovered that
they were forged.


**The troubles**

It still remains unclear what
exact role Mr Keter played to occasion the arrest, his connection
with the two individuals and why

Judges and magistrates
have vowed to defend the
Constitution and to fearlessly uphold the rule of
law.
Through their association,
judges and magistrates admitted there are instances
where people get dissatisfied
with outcomes of decisions
rendered by courts but said
the law provides a way forward on what to do in such
circumstances.
They said they have
resolved to continue dispensing justice even in the
wake of a recent trend of
disobeying court orders.
“The membership of
Kenya Judges and Magistrates Association is resolute
that we shall uphold the rule
of law, steadfastly defend the
Constitution and diligently
dispense justice without
fear or favour,” said KMJA
secretary general Derrick



Kuto.
The association condemned disobedience of
court orders, warning that
the country could plunge
into lawlessness.
They urged Kenyans to
support the Judiciary in its
quest to defend the Constitution and uphold the rule of
law as well as abstain from
attacking individual judges
or magistrates.
“When there is disregard
of court orders, no citizen is
assured of protection of his
or her right as guaranteed
by the Constitution, the
absence of law and order
will plunge the country into
chaos,” said Mr Kuto who is
also a magistrate.
KMJA said the Judiciary
respects other arms of the
government and values
interdependence with each
other.
“Occasionally, parties
that come to court may
be dissatisfied with decisions rendered by judicial
officers but they still have
recourse in law in such circumstances,” he added.
Their statement comes
only a day after the Law
Society of Kenya called on
the government to respect
the rule of law. On Thursday,
lawyers held a protest walk
to condemn disobedience of
court orders."

enya is banking on the reduced
cost of clearing and moving
〇〇〇

Port to Uganda and the progress of
the standard gauge railway project to
revive its bid to extend the line to its
neighbour.
During a bilateral meeting between
President Uhuru Kenyatta and his
Ugandan counterpart Yoweri Museveni at State House, Nairobi, yesterday,
Kenya said the speed of clearing goods
and the upcoming cargo trains are the
answer to Uganda’s transport needs.
Yesterday, President Kenyatta said
that the completion of the second
container terminal increased the port’s
overall holding capacity to 1.65 million
containers per year, with its capacity
expected to hit 2.7 million containers
per year once the three-stage project
is complete.
“The modernisation programme has
resulted in reduced average time to import and export goods through the port
of Mombasa – from 11 days to under
3.5 days – and work for even greater
efficiency continues,” State House said
in a statement yesterday.



added, will also serve Uganda through
the Lake Victoria ports of Jinja, Masaka
and Entebbe.
Yesterday’s talks largely focused on
the SGR and the East African Community.
Phase Two of the SGR – Nairobi to
Naivasha – is on course, and is expected
to be completed in 2019.
From Naivasha, the Heads of State
agreed yesterday that the line would
be done jointly towards the border in
Malaba, Busia County onwards.
Uganda had already earlier committed to ensure that at least 80 per cent of
all cargo its cargo would be transported
through SGR.
On Somalia, where Kenyan and
Ugandan soldiers have joined the
African Union Mission (AMISOM),
President Museveni agreed to convene
a meeting of Chiefs of Defence Forces
from Troop Contributing Countries to
discuss progress in the mission.
Thereafter, State House said,
President Museveni would consider
convening a summit of the countries
with troops in Somalia.
“On the continued deployment of
troops in Somalia, the leaders emphasised that it was necessary for
the Somali government to continue
building and strengthening its national
army,” the statement said.
Further, President Museveni will convene a meeting of EAC Trade Ministers
in Kampala in January to chart the way
forward on the European Union aid
as a follow-up to discussions held in
Brussels earlier in the year.



And with the commissioning of the
Inland Container Depot at Embakasi,
President Kenyatta told his counterpart
that more goods would be transported
by train.
“This will further shorten the time
of moving goods from Mombasa to
Kenya’s hinterland and neighbouring
countries as well as the cost for doing
so by a further 30 per cent,” the statement added.
Uncertainty hit the joint KenyaUganda SGR project after Uganda said
it was considering building a railway
through Tanzania instead.
It is estimated that more than 50 per
cent of the cargo handled at the Port



of Mombasa is destined for markets
like Uganda, with 11.2 million tonnes
of cargo moved between the two nations annually.
On his part, President Museveni
told President Kenyatta that “Uganda

was ready and committed to the SGR
project, and would work with Kenya
to achieve its commitment.”
Mr Museveni had in July approved
the borrowing of $2.9 billion for the
construction of the railway from the
Malaba border to its capital Kampala,
giving the clearest signal yet that the
regional infrastructure project was
back on track.
“Both Presidents agreed on working
jointly on taking the SGR line from
Naivasha to Kisumu and onwards to
Malaba on the border with Uganda,” a
statement from State House said after
the joint meeting.

Opposition chief Raila Odinga has congratulated South
Africa’s Vice-President Cyril
Ramaphosa on his election as
the new leader of the country’s
independence party, the African
National Congress.
In a statement, the Nasa
leader said the win by Mr Ramaphosa, whom he considered a
personal friend, signals a new
era of democracy in Africa.
Mr Ramaphosa on Monday
won the hotly contested race
against his closest rival, former
African Union Commission
chairperson Nkosazana DlaminiZuma, ex-wife of South Africa’s
President Jacob Zuma.
The anti-apartheid hero garnered 2,440 votes against Dr
Dlamini-Zuma’s 2,261.
“The news of our comrade
Cyril Ramaphosa’s election as
the leader of the African National
Congress will thrill democrats in
South Africa, across Africa and,
indeed, throughout the world,”
said Mr Odinga in a statement
on Monday evening.
He added: “From this pivotal
ANC position, and drawing on
South Africa’s recently diminished but still vibrant global
standing, he will restore the high
respect that his nation, as well
as the continent, enjoyed under
the fabled leadership of Nelson
Mandela in particular.”

President Uhuru Kenyatta
has criticised the Opposition
for allegedly being weak in its
oversight role.
In an opinion article published in _The Washington_
_Times,_ the President accuses
the Raila Odinga-led opposition
of running theatrics that “may
keep them in the newspapers,
but they do not make them
relevant”. President Kenyatta
says that the Opposition had
failed in its role to scrutinise
and seriously inquire about
government programmes in
his first term, a task he says
Kenyans expected of them.
He says that Kenya had made
commendable strides in other
tenets of democracy and had
a fearless and free press, a
working devolved governance,
a powerfully independent judiciary, and a vibrant multiparty



democracy.
“I believe there remains a
final element unaccounted for
in Kenya — required for our
multi-party democracy to reach
full maturity: a strong, bold and
inquisitive elected opposition.
One that holds government accountable for performance, the
implementation of promises,
and use of public money,” the
President wrote in the opinion
dated December 18.
In the 769-word piece titled
“Kenya deserves a strong and
credible opposition,” the Head
of State, who was sworn in for
a second term on November
28, argues that the Opposition had failed in its role to
build a more democratic, and
freer country.
“We have an Opposition that
is competitive in elections, capable of rallying thousands to
their cause, and with considerable strength in Parliament.
However, for the past five years
as key government decisions
were made — on infrastructure
programmes, education, health
and on military action against
al-Shabaab — none faced the
serious scrutiny that should be
expected from an opposition in
Parliament,” he said. “Instead
of focusing on bread-and-butter issues, they have sought a
new referendum on Kenya’s

Mombasa have been rendered
jobless, thanks to increase in the
volume of goods transported by
train through the Standard Gauge
Railway.
The Kenya Ports Authority
(KPA) issued a directive in June that
containers destined to Mombasa
for local clearance would not be
allowed to be nominated by clients
to any CFS.
“The nomination shall be done
by KPA based on vessel rotation,
volumes, and individual CFS capacity; you are required to inform
your clients in your various ports
of loading accordingly,” said KPA
in the June statement.
Yesterday, the Nation learnt that
CFSs and transport fi rms in Mombasa have started laying off workers
following reduced business.
More than 500 truck drivers
and 100 workers in CFSs have
been declared redundant after the
government ordered cargo to be



CFS Association has already
moved to court to challenge the
directive and the case is pending.
“That directive has totally affected our business. As we speak,
I have sacked 30 people from the
company. Some have even received
their sacking letters today,” said a
senior manager at one of the CFSs
in Mombasa who asked not to be
named.
He said the CFS receives very
little cargo that can no longer
sustain its business.
“The work that we used to do has
now been transferred to Nairobi
and we can no longer pay our staff .
All the CFSs in Mombasa are facing
a bleak future. There is no future
in this business anymore,” he said.
“Now even the little cargo that
KPA has allocated to us, Kenya
Revenue Authority(KRA) wants
port clearance. That begs the question, is it that there is scarcity of
jobs or just that they want to end
the CFS business. These actions
tell us that there is no hope in this
business,” he said.
Some CFSs have also been



forced to relocate to Nairobi or
start branches there. A number of
businesses that relied on the CFSs
and transporters in Mombasa have
also been aff ected as local economy
feels the pinch of transfer of business to Nairobi.
Apex steel company assistant
manager Daniel Ndege said the
company is feeling the heat of the
directive as it is incurring unnecessary costs. “The issue is that they
are trying to force us to transport
the containers to Nairobi and for
us we do nominations on our side.
If we do nominations, we have the
full mandate to nominate the CFS
we need as importers in Kenya.
So if you force us to track the
containers to Nairobi and we are
based in Mombasa, then defi nitely

things and incurring double costs.
A container reaching Nairobi and
returning it back to Mombasa is a
loss,” he said.
Mr Ndege said SGR should engage in competitive business and
not stifl e competitors.

Ireri said: “As we speak now, a
cargo train carries 108 containers
and making seven trips daily. That
literally means that more than
500 truck drivers are currently

no business and this is to the detriment of our members, who have
pumped billions of shillings into
buying trucks, trailers and other

Sub-standard goods are still fi nding
their way into the Kenyan market even
as the government intensifi es the fi ght
against counterfeits and contraband
goods. This emerged yesterday from
a report by the multiagency committee formed in May to crack down on
counterfeits.
According to Trade Cabinet Secretary Peter Munya, the government
seized sub-standard goods worth more
than Sh7.5 billion between May and
June. The majority of the confi scated
goods during the crackdown were
cosmetics, alcohol, building and construction materials and electricals.
Others were household appliances,
foodstuff s, motor vehicle spare parts,
cooking gas, sugar, cigarettes and textiles. During the crackdown, 1.3 million
50kg bags of sugar were impounded
and subjected to tests. Of the 1.2 million bags so far tested by the standards
agency, 837,244 bags representing 66
per cent of the sample failed the test.
Mr Munya noted that the sugar had
either yeast, high moisture, yeast or
moulds. He further dismissed claims
that there was mercury in table sugar
as earlier reported, adding that the
sugar in the market is safe for consumption. “The main concern was the
high moisture content in the sugar as a
result of poor handling in the traders’
facilities,” he said. The government
has vowed to take stiff action against
its offi cers should it be discovered
that negligence on their part saw the







after 25 days of investigations,
but the committee has been given
seven more days.
The ministry’s report is signed
by Health Principal Secretary
Peter Tum and was delivered to
the committee by the Director of
Health at the ministry.
However, a member of the committee said one of the committee
chairs was “so nervous when the
report was brought that instead
of presenting it to the members
for scrutiny, he demanded that
the laboratory technician (from





the government chemist) who did
the tests be summoned”.
“The chairman is trying to
force the members into delaying
this much-awaited report on the
basis that we risk destroying the
economy. But the matter touches
on the lives of Kenyans,” the
member who did not want to be
named said.
But Mr Kega denied the claim,
saying the committee needs to
present a conclusive report “not
one based on rumours”.

**BY DAVID MWERE**


The voting by members of the
National Assembly on the two-thirds
gender Bill scheduled for Wednesday
afternoon is likely to be postponed to
allow room for lobbying.
Debate on the Bill, which seeks to
amend articles 97 and 98 of the Constitution to introduce special nomination
slots for women MPs to bridge the gender representation gap in Parliament,
ended last Wednesday.
Yesterday, Majority leader Aden
Duale, who is the mover of the Bill,
said President Uhuru Kenyatta’s Jubilee
party has not planned for any parliamentary group meeting to whip MPs
to support the proposal.
This is because the President and his
deputy William Ruto will be attending
the blue economy conference at the
Kenyatta International Convention
Centre (KICC) on Tuesday.


**Numbers**
“If we see the numbers in the House
are not looking good, I will seek the
permission of the Speaker to have it
deferred. But we are trying all we can
to ensure that we get the numbers,”
Mr Duale said.
About 42 new seats are required in
the National Assembly to attain a third
of the 349 members (117 members).
The House currently has 75 women
MPs; 22 elected, 47 county women
representatives and six nominated.
The Senate has 18 nominated women
senators and three elected and requires
about five women slots to meet the
requirements of article 81 (b) of the
Constitution, which provides that not
more than two-thirds of appointive and
elective public bodies shall be of the
same gender.
Normally before voting on a Bill of
such magnitude takes place, MPs are
whipped in their respective parliamentary group meetings.
For the Bill to sail through, the support of the Jubilee party, the largest
party in the House, is crucial because
it requires two-thirds majority or at
least 233 of the 349 MPs in the National
Assembly.


**Threshold**
Failure to reach this threshold will
mean that the Bill cannot progress to
the next level and can only be reintroduced in the House after six months.
But even as Mr Duale spoke, Nasa
leader Raila Odinga is expected to
chair a Nasa parliamentary group (PG)
meeting at Orange House on Tuesday
morning to rally the members’ support
for the bill.
Mr Odinga, who was appointed Africa Union’s High Representative for
Infrastructure Development in Africa
last month, is currently in Zimbabwe
on an official function.
Minority whip in the National Assembly Junet Mohamed said the party
is keen to have the Bill passed.
“I can confirm that there will be a
PG to appeal to our members on the
need of passing the Bill,” Mr Junet said.
However, the task of saving the Bill
now lies with Mr Duale, the mover,
who under Standing Order 53 (3) can
request House Speaker Justin Muturi
to delay putting the question for the
Second Reading until such time when
not less than 233 MPs will be available
as required by the Constitution.





~~**The scandal >**~~ ~~CRBC nets Sh1 billion every month~~

“The corporation is aware of
the investigations and we are
co-operating with authorities
to ensure the SGR ticketing
is secure and maintained,” Mr
Mainga said as he allayed “any
unfounded fears surrounding the
future and integrity of ticketing.”
He added that the loss of
funds could have “presumably
affected passengers who purchased tickets from elsewhere
and not the officially recognised
channels”.
“The corporation has lent sup


port to the investigators who are
still undertaking a forensic audit
to ascertain the true position of
the system,” he said.
Three top Chinese staff have
been arrested after an attempt
to bribe Directorate of Criminal
Investigations officers failed.
They are expected in court today.
The scandal, unearthed by the
corporation’s workers monitoring the Chinese operator, is the
latest to hit the Mombasa-Nairobi standard gauge railway.
The railway was built by
the operator at Sh247 billion,
largely in loans from Chinese
Government.
CRBC is reportedly paid Sh1
billion every month to run the
service, on top of the loan the
government pays.
The scam involves manipulating the complex booking system
to split ticketing revenues between the railway operator and
insiders.

can then move goods from Naivasaha SGR to Naivasha MGR. Then
we have a seamless movement of
goods from Mombasa all the way
to Kampala.” Forced by unfavourable fi nancing by the Chinese, the
change of mind back to the old line
signals a reality check for government offi cials who spent the last
fi ve years fi ghting back criticism
on the cost of the line.
Nairobi signed another three
infrastructure financing deals,
including the construction of the
Waiyaki Way-Jomo Kenyatta International Airport expressway, a
Sh51 billion project that was once
linked to the World Bank before it
pulled out mysteriously.
They also signed for funding
to expand the Northern bypass
and ease congestion as well as
another on the construction and
maintenance of the Konza data
centre and smart cities project
worth Sh175 billion.
The deals are worth Sh226
billion and are made through
concessional fi nancing and public-private-partnership (PPP), State
House said.
But the President’s delegation
sought to downplay the criticism,
arguing China was more important
in other things as well.
“People have come to think that
the collaboration with China is
just about SGR only. Things have
changed. Because now we are looking at the perspective of having a
corridor which is very viable both
socially and economically,” Mr
Macharia argued.
It means the government will
now focus on building a link rail
between the old line and the SGR
at Naivasha, some 43 kilometres
apart.

t can now be revealed that
diffi cult loan conditions were
〇〇〇

to get funding for the second phase
of the SGR.
China refused to extend part of
the funding as a grant and also
wanted “suffi cient proof of viability” before they could authorise
the deal to construct the standard
gauge railway beyond Naivasha.
Yesterday, Transport CS James
Macharia said the SGR, which
has reached Naivasha, will now be
linked to the old line to ensure there
is no disruption in transportation.
The latest developments come as
a slap in the face for Nairobi, which
had appeared assured of clinching
the Sh368 billion fi nancing to extend the line to Kisumu.
Sources told the _Saturday Nation_
that the decision followed lack of
progress on changing conditions
imposed by the Chinese. President
Uhuru Kenyatta had asked for half
of the money to be given as a grant
and the balance be in a loan with
more relaxed conditions.
And, though Kenya accepted to
allow the Chinese to build, run and
hand it over once they recoup their
money, the Chinese reportedly
insisted on proof that the SGR will
be viable. The line, already running
from Mombasa to Nairobi (with
the Naivasha extension due for
completion in August), has ferried
2.6 million passengers and 3.6 tons
of cargo since it was launched in
June 2017.
But it made a loss of Sh10 billion
in the fi rst year. Kenyan offi cials
had argued that the initial loss was



to be expected as public awareness
of the railway usage was still low.
Nairobi asked for the grant to be
given as part of the Belt and Road
Initiative, offi cials said.
The Chinese, though, insisted
on collateral, something Nairobi
had gone to Beijing to avoid. Traditionally, the Chinese have used
grants and interest-free loans to
rope in least developed countries
to its Belt and Road Initiative.
Yesterday, Transport CS James
Macharia said the government was
rethinking the railway for now,
until “we have investments on that
corridor which actually add value
to the SGR and the entire country.”
“The metre-gauge railway was
done many years ago. It is being
used to transport goods to Uganda
and we have to make sure that that
connectivity (between SGR and old
railway line) is quickly addressed
and one of the discussions we are
making in this visit is how we can
quickly close that gap,” he said.
“We have already put proposals
to make sure that when we fi nish
the SGR in Naivasha in August, we



FILE | NATION
na has shied off from investing further


unless it is linked to Uganda.
In its current state, the SGR is
still struggling to break even
despite being operational since
June 2017. In its fi rst year of
operation, the Mombasa-Nairobi
line earned Sh10.33 billion.
Kenya National Bureau of
Statistics (KNBS) data shows
the passenger service earned a
paltry Sh1.61 billion. The freight
services which were launched
in January last year brought in
Sh8.72 billion as at the end of
last year.
The government is, however,



paying China Communications
Construction Company a billion
shillings a month to run the
railway. This translates to Sh12
billion annually to run a railway
that is not only loss-making but
one whose loans are supposed to
be paid starting this year.
Kenya in May 2014 entered
into a deal to borrow $3.233 billion loan (Sh324.01 billion) from
China’s Exim Bank, comprised
of $1.633 billion commercial loan
and $1.6 billion concessional to
build a 385km modern railway
between Mombasa and Nairobi.
The five-year grace period
given by the China Exim bank
comes to an end this year. Tax
payers will from June cough out
Sh56.7 billion or 0.7 per cent of
the economy to the Chinese for
funding the Nairobi Mombasa
leg of the SGR.
Experts say it is not surprising
that China has refused to lend
Kenya more money.
“If you had a colleague of
yours who you know has fi nancial issues and they came back
to ask you for more money and
you know they may never pay
back, will you give them? That
is the human aspect of it,” said
Mr Robert Shaw, a public fi nance
and policy expert.
“China has realised that it
has got into projects all over the
world without due diligence so it
has decided to take a keener look
on its loan portfolio,” he said.
Kampala, which was thought
to hold the key to unlocking the
SGR funds, agreed with Kenya
to build a railway line in 2008
but the arrangements were only
concretised in 2012. By then,
Kenya was on the last stages
of negotiations with China for
the Mombasa-Nairobi SGR line."

Ministers in charge of implementing
the Northern Corridor Integration Projects (NCIP) in Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda
and South Sudan have until September
to conclude fi nancing agreements for
construction of the Standard Gauge
Railway in the region.
The fi nancial agreement is for the
construction of Naivasha-Kisumu, Kisumu-Malaba, Malaba-Kampala sections
that fall within the NCIP.
A Heads of State Summit hosted by
President Uhuru Kenyatta in Nairobi and
attended by President Yoweri Museveni
of Uganda and President Paul Kagame
of Rwanda with President Salva Kiir of
South Sudan represented by a special
envoy, Mr Aggrey Tisa Sabuni, further
directed that the application for fi nancing
of the Kampala-Bihanga-Mirama-Kigali,
Tororo-Gulu-Nimule/Gulu-Pakwach
section be expedited.


**Earned praise**
“The summit directs Uganda and
South Sudan to fast-track the bankable
feasibility studies for the remaining
northern, western and Bihalanga-Kasese-Mpondwe; Nimule-Juba sections,”
the presidents said in a joint statement.
During the meeting, Kenya’s progress
in the construction of SGR earned it
praise from the regional Heads of State.
“The Summit lauds the completion
and commissioning of Mombasa-Nairobi section of the SGR in 2017 which
is already transporting an increasing
number of passengers and cargo,” the
leaders noted.
President Kenyatta underscored the
immense benefi ts of the joint interventions initiated under the NCIP since its
inception in 2013.
“It is defi nitely good news for our
citizens,” said President Kenyatta as
he cited joint actions such as the single
customs territory that has resulted in
reduced transit times and cost of goods.
He assured his regional colleagues that
Kenya would sustain the momentum in
implementation of the remaining phases
of the SGR to reach the Kenya-Uganda
border town of Malaba.


**The Summit**
President Museveni lauded the Summit, saying Uganda’s economy relied
largely on its neighbours such as Kenya
that buy its excess produce such as
maize and milk.
“I used to take milk from Kenya but
now it’s Kenya and other East African
countries that are consuming our milk.
We have about 2.5 billion litres of milk
but we can only consume 800 million
litres, the remaining 1.7 million is being
consumed by other East African countries,” said President Museveni.
He directed Uganda Revenue Authority
offi cials based at the port of Mombasa to
ensure that there is no backlog of cargo
destined to Uganda at the port.
President Kagame thanked President
Kenyatta for reconvening the Summit
after a two-year break.
“We can now keep up the momentum
in fashioning and implementing joint
initiatives and projects for the benefi t
of our region,” said President Kagame.
The summit was also attended by
Kenya's Deputy President William Ruto
as well as representatives of Tanzania,
Burundi and Ethiopia, countries which
have observer status in the NCIP.

But speaking yesterday, MPs

and Kisumu East MP Shakeel

Mr Ruto, asking him to subject
himself to a lifestyle audit and

them are stunned by Uhuru's
determination to slay the dragon
of corruption and want to use

by the DP’s allies were proof of
Jubilee's raging factional wars.
Mr Atandi said: “We insist that
Ruto must initiate lifestyle audits
on his close aides.”
And addressing a press conference at Parliament Buildings
yesterday, the three “rebel” MPs
from Mr Ruto’s North Rift backyard supported the lifestyle audit
and dismissed those linking it to
a plot targeting the DP.

It is the property of Mr
Caroli Omondi, who was
once a top offi cial in Mr Raila
Odinga's offi ce when the latter was the prime minister.
He quit in 2010 following a

“The tenancy comes to an
end on December 31 and it
will be by mutual consent,”
Mr Ong'wen said in a statement yesterday.
“This understanding was
arrived at on May 28 and is
in writing.”
A daily reported yesterday that the party had been
ejected from its headquarters
after Mr Omondi refused to
renew the tenancy.
Mr Ong'wen said the
owner of the building, which
is on Menelik Road, wants
to pull it down and erect a

Mr Muli was adamant that
without the study, the Government of Kenya lacked an

especially on the cost implications. But, it later emerged, the

The board was told an independent survey would tell the

Revelations on Friday that the
standard gauge railway (SGR)
will stop in Naivasha for the
foreseeable future and goods
moved through the old line
has created uncertainty about
Kenya’s biggest infrastructure
project.
After spending more than
Sh500 billion to build a railway
from Mombasa to a little know
destination in Narok County
bordering Naivasha, the Jubilee
administration appears to have
unwittingly adopted previous
arguments by critics that it
should have simply rehabilitated
the metre gauge railway at a
fraction of the cost.
This also raises questions
about the original SGR plan
even as State House yesterday
denied extension of the loan
from Naivasha to Kisumu was on
the table. By July 13, 2015, Kenya
Railways approved the feasibility
study and the preliminary design
based on the Southern route
(Nairobi-Naivasha-Narok-Bomet-Kisumu-Malaba.
In fact, the Attorney General, according to a brief to the
National Assembly Transport
Committee, had approved the
commercial contracts for the
Naivasha -Malaba SGR as early
as March 2016 and the new shift
will now among other things
even disrupt the Kisumu port
plan, which has been central to
the SGR narrative.
How the new plan fi ts into the
old one after immense eff ort to
design its feasibility and business sense remains uncertain. It
has lifted the pomp associated
with the line that was set to be
opened in July by President
Uhuru Kenyatta, and thrown
land dealers who had eyed bil


lions in compensation along the
line beyond Naivasha as well as
put railway experts back to the
drawing board.
The metre gauge railway route
becomes Nairobi’s Plan C after
previous statements by Transport Cabinet Secretary James
Macharia on at least reaching
Kisumu with an eye on extending
it to Uganda and Rwanda.
Mr Macharia’s revelations during the Belt and Road Forum in
Beijing will also present a huge
planning nightmare as the SGR
ends in Duka Moja, more than
43km to the old railway line in
Naivasha.
It also a belated admission
that indeed Kenya could have
saved billions by upgrading the
metre gauge railway line instead
of going for the expensive SGR
whose land acquisition and
construction costs will be a pain
on Kenya’s fi nances for years
to come.
Kenya may also have erred
in the rush to start the railway
line alone even as much as the
SGR protocol remained a Kenya,
Uganda, Rwanda and South



already feeling the eff ects of the railway line,
in terms of infrastructure and value of land.
Mr Parsayia Kisongoi, a community
leader, said that for years, the area had
been neglected in terms of infrastructure
but this had changed since the SGR construction began.
He said if the project ends at the current
spot, it risks taking residents back to where
they have been.
“We have seen the value of land rise and
the contractors have assisted in building
some classes, water pans and even rehabilitating rural roads and we are grateful,”
he said.
Residents around Kisumu were also excited about the prospect of getting a windfall
from the project.
To address that, an NLC official in
Kisumu, who spoke with the Sunday Nation on condition of anonymity, said the
commission has been deliberately delaying
to publish details of aff ected land so that
unscrupulous individuals cannot come up
with infl ated fi gures.
The offi cial said the move is intended to
bar people from speculating and building
structures along the line in order to demand
for a higher pay.
“We have in the past experienced an
infl ux of buildings and structures as well
as farming along the SGR line and this has
often caused the commission to spend more
money in paying up for the cost of land plus
the buildings,” he said yesterday.
“This is one of the reasons why there is
variance in payment from one section to the
next as some people also move to settle in
the areas. Displacing them will mean that
we spend more money,” added the offi cial.
On the other hand, it will be good news
to those along the route of the old railway,
which will be rehabilitated at a cost of Sh40
billion. The residents of Nakuru, Molo,
Londiani, Muhoroni areas whose hopes of
having a train pass by was already dashed
with the SGR plan, as they watched the
old-line rot are now preparing for a revival.

State House yesterday came out to forcefully deny
reports that Kenya’s loan request for extension of
the standard gauge railway (SGR) from Naivasha
to Kisumu had been turned down by the Chinese.
Chief of Staff Nzioka Waita said the question
of funding for the extension of the rail to Kisumu
was not part of the agenda of the meeting between
President Uhuru Kenyatta and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping.
“The President cannot be said to be returning
home empty-handed for something he did not
request. The headlines are not only factually incor

〇〇〇



However, while insisting that Kenya did not
discuss any funding proposals for the extension
of the railway, Mr Waita noted that SGR project is
a regional project and the complexities in negotiating its completion involve several countries and
securing fi nancing for its completion could take
years of intricate negotiations.
“Given the public interest in the matter it is
important to acknowledge that the SGR Phase
2A of the Railway from Nairobi to Naivasha
will be complete by August 2019,” he stated.
President Kenyatta highlighted to his counterpart
the plans of his government to break ground on
the industrial park and dry port to be constructed



damaging to the reputation of the people and the
government,” he said.
The Chief of Staff was reacting to yesterday’s
news reports that China had rejected Kenya’s
request for an additional loan to extend the SGR.
Before he left for China on Tuesday, reports had
circulated that the SGR loan was one of the items on
his agenda. In fact, opposition leader Raila Odinga
who accompanied the President to China had told
his supporters that Kenya would be looking to tie
down the deal during the visit to Beijing. However,
Transport Cabinet Secretary James Macharia announced the government would upgrade the old
railway line from Naivasha to Malaba at a cost of"

be our priority. What is the point of
them funding the extension of SGR
if our people do not have jobs? We
survived for 55 years without SGR and
we will survive whether they fund the
extension or not,” said Mr Gachagua.
The MP, who is also a member of
the House infrastructure committee,
said any trade relationship with the
Chinese should be based on mutual
benefi t and respect not threats and
intimidation.
“What they give us are not favours.
It is loans that we repay. We might be
poorer than them, but we have our
dignity and we will defend it. That is
something the British learnt the hard
way,” added Mr Gachagua.
The Mathira MP has drafted amendments to the Public Procurement
and Asset Disposal Act 2015 so that
contracts whose value is less that Sh1
billion are reserved exclusively for
Kenyans-owned companies. External contractors will be awarded such
contracts in the event local fi rms do
not qualify.
“We are killing our industries because the Chinese import everything;
from cement, ballast and even labour.

Institute of Economic Aff airs chief
executive Kwame Owino described
the ambassador’s comments of the
fi sh imports row as a “trade war” as
“an exaggeration, and an attempt to
gloss over questions Kenya has asked.”
“To call what is happening a trade
war is most unfortunate, because a
trade war is a completely diff erent
thing. What I heard the President
say is that, “Look, we are having fi sh
from China, its cost is so low, and we
are not too sure how it is prepared.’
This is a food item, and its inspection
should be fi rm, and if it is not, then
it shouldn’t come,” said Mr Owino.
“Is it a trade war? Defi nitely not.
That cannot qualify as a trade war
under any circumstances, and you guys
should have called him out.”

enya was yesterday putting
on a brave face following

shelved plans to extend the Standard Gauge Railway from Malaba to
Kampala until “unresolved issues
with Kenya and China have been
concluded"".
Transport Cabinet Secretary
James Macharia said that Kenya
was instead revamping the Kisumu Port in Lake Victoria to ease
movement of goods via the lake to
Uganda and Rwanda in case the
SGR terminates at Kisumu.
“In the worst case scenario, the
Kisumu port would serve Rwanda
and Uganda. We are, however,
moving phase by phase. Thinking
about Malaba for now is too much
for the plate,” Mr Macharia said in
an interview with the _Nation._
Mr Macharia is currently in
China to conclude negotiations for
funding the Naivasha to Kisumu
SGR line.
Kenya secured a Sh150 billion
loan from China to extend its
railway from Nairobi to Naivasha
and construction is ongoing. The
Mombasa — Nairobi SGR line was
completed in mid-last year.
Uganda Finance minister Matia
Kasaija on Monday told _Daily_
_Nation_ ’s sister publication, the
_Daily Monitor,_ that the Uganda
government had put on hold the
SGR venture and has instead
turned attention to revamping the
old metre-gauge railway network.
The Chinese-fi nanced project
is the fi rst stage in a scheme that
aims to extend to Uganda and other
landlocked countries.
The goal is to cut the cost of
transport and boost trade, by replacing a slower, narrow-gauge line.

Uganda’s fi rst phase of SGR,
the eastern line running from
Malaba to Kampala, is about
273km and is expected to cost
about Sh234 billion.
Mr Kasaija said that Uganda
has currently taken a back seat
on the SGR venture, but will
resume “serious discussions

Kenya for failing to commit
themselves to financing the
remaining two — Naivasha-Kisumu, and Kisumu-Malaba

President Uhuru Kenyatta has
described Kenya’s debt, which is
expected to hit the Sh7 trillion
mark when his term ends, as a
healthy mix.
He questioned the increased
focus on the Sh559.1 billion
Kenya owes China.
""Why are we focusing on only
one lender?"" Mr Kenyatta asked
in an interview with CNN's
Richard Quest aired on Monday night.
""As far as I am concerned, we
have a very healthy mix of debt
from multilateral lenders — who
are basically the World Bank
and the African Development
Bank — to bilateral ones like
Japan, China and France, all
who are … working … to help
us achieve our objectives,"" Mr
Kenyatta said.
The country's total debt is
Sh5 trillion.
Kenya owes Italy Sh101.9 billion, Germany (Sh34.7 billion),



Belgium (Sh10.2 billion) and the
United States (Sh2.9 billion).
Others are the International
Development Association
(Sh516.8 billion), Africa Development Bank (Sh204.8 billion)
and the International Monetary
Fund (Sh71.6 billion).
The President said Japan is
the biggest lender to Kenya's
port projects while France funds
electricity generation.
The comments by Mr Kenyatta were aired on the same day
Treasury Principal Secretary
Kamau Thugge told Bloomberg
of plans to raise Sh287 billion
bond — Sh250 billion Eurobond
and Sh37 billion from the local
market.
The news of the Sh250 billion
bond comes just eight months
after Kenya raised Sh202 billion, a big chunk of which was
largely used to clear a syndicated loan of Sh101 billion.
With an interest rate of 7.25
per cent and 8.25 per cent for
the 10 and 30-year bonds respectively, Kenya is expected



to pay back the bonds when
they mature in 2028 and 2048.
The biggest issue Kenya
had with debt, and the bonds
was in 2014 when the country
first floated a Sh280 billion
Eurobond.
Opposition leader Raila
Odinga questioned how such
a massive amount was pumped
into the economy ""without “anyone feeling it”.
In the Monday interview, Mr
Quest wanted to know if the
President ""is aware China has
another agenda"" in the loans
being given to African countries.
""Our infrastructure gap needs
to be fi lled and we are going to
work with partners across the
globe,"" Mr Kenyatta said.
He added that Kenya's high
ratio of debt against the Gross
Domestic Product ""does not
bother me"".
""What would worry me is if
the debt has gone to recurrent
expenditure, has gone into
paying salaries or electricity
bills and so on,"" he said."

Passengers make their way to the train at the Standard Gauge Railway
Nairobi terminus on May 31.


〇〇〇

The changing numbers is
only the surface of a struggling
railway line whose existence has
raised controversy. The cargo
business, which was the main
hope of revenue, has failed to
yield after it turned out to be
more expensive than the roads
option.
Last month, a memorandum
sent before Cabinet detailed
how various layers of inefficiencies made the use of SGR to
transport cargo from Mombasa
to Nairobi more than twice


〇〇〇

Mombasa to Nairobi by road is
Sh65,000 and Sh85,000 respectively, the cost for ferrying the
same cargo on SGR averages
at Sh142,000 and Sh212,000
respectively.
“The difference between
road and rail for 20ft and 40ft
amount to $770 (118 per cent
increase) and $1,270 (149 per
cent increase) respectively,”
the traders through a technical
committee wrote to Cabinet.
The report says movement
of containers from vessel to


〇〇〇

demurrage charges. The insider
records from Kenya Railways
also show a badly skewed function of the SGR as merely an
import tool.
In April 2018, Transport
Cabinet Secretary (CS) James
Macharia said there would be
12 cargo trains operating by
December of the same year
The CS would later tell a
parliamentary joint committee
that the SGR was running eight
trains per day which was making Sh2.12 billion in monthly
revenue compared to its Sh1.7
billion operating cost, basically
making Sh424 million profit.
Yesterday, CS Macharia declined to be drawn into any
discussion over the SGR operations deflecting the questions
to Kenya Railways instead.
“You need to direct these
questions to the procuring
entity (Kenya Railways),” the
CS replied to a text message
asking him which numbers he
would stand with regarding the
SGR revenues and his projection on when the project would
break even.
Kenya Railways had not responded by the time of going to
press. Any criticism of the SGR
operations are, how ever, met
with vicious reaction from gov

and facilitating ease of moving
train parts for repair in China
and importing train parts into the
country without paying any tax.
The contract further empowers the Chinese operator with
a “non-exclusive license to use,
copy, modify any intellectual
property KR has”.
Terminating the agreement is
also made an equally costly affair
with KRC required to pay for
transport of equipment and staff
back to China after clearing any
outstanding obligations owed to
the operator.
Also, just like the financing
deal for SGR, Kenya agreed to
waive any sovereignty or any
immunity on KRC and its assets
whenever there is a dispute.
In what appears like a major
step though, the operation
contract unlike the financing
agreement, allows for arbitration of disputes to be made by
a neutral party.
The language of arbitration
is also set as English and the
place for hearing the arbitration
allowed to be in Nairobi.
With ongoing wearing of the
used locomotives purchased in
2017 to run the line, increasing
cost of operations and the limitation of the line capacity at
16 trains per day, SGR’s trip to
profitability may be a steep slope
based on the conditions of the
operations contract.

ecrecy and suspicion have characterised the operations of the
〇〇〇

two years since the first train made its
maiden trip to Nairobi.
Exactly how much revenue the trains
make and what taxpayers are forking
out to support the operations of the
SGR as well as how many trains are
operated in a day remains anyone’s
guess since the project was rolled out.
It depends on who you ask or what
data you are reading when it comes
to the volume of passengers or cargo
ferried on the line, or even the amount
earned from the service in which Kenya
has sank billions of taxpayers’ money
borrowed from China.
Data like safety records are only
shared among top management of
selected government agencies. The
_Sunday Nation_ has since seen one such
data released in April 2019 on cargo
freight services which show that there
has been at least one accident in every
three days since the cargo services
were launched in January 2018.
“There has been a total of 187
accidents reported at Mombasa and
Nairobi since the commencement of
the freight operations in July 2017.
Most of these accidents are related
to loading and offloading activities
whereby a crane operator lifts off
a container from the wagon before
the container is fully detached from
the twist lock. Thus, lifting both the
wagon and the container resulting in
damaging the wagons’ air valves,” says
the report.
The most tightly guarded secret,
however, remains the revenues with
even the country’s official data source,
the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics
(KNBS) contradicting itself on just
how much the SGR made in its first
year of operation.
In March 2019, the agency put the
figure at Sh10.3 billion, a figure that
even the Chinese Ambassador to Kenya
Wu Peng last month lauded as “near
break-even in just one year.”
The ambassador went further to laud
the huge economic benefits the SGR
was giving Kenya with the trip between
Mombasa and Nairobi now reduced
from “over 10 hours to five hours and
over 2.77 million passengers having
been carried on the line.
KNBS in its latest Leading Economic Indicators however revised the
first-year revenue of the SGR to Sh5.7
billion, casting doubt on the brilliant
numbers that have been used to justify
false hope for the line’s ability to even
pay for its operations.
KNBS Director-General Zachary
Mwangi told Sunday Nation that the
agency was engaging Kenya Railways
to find out where the conflicting data
came from.
“We got the numbers from Kenya
Railways and we have began engaging them to know why the numbers
changed. We need to find the story
behind the changing numbers and in
our net release before the end of this
month, we should be able to reveal
what happened,” Mr Mwangi said adding doubt to the agency’s data which
recently painted a picture of booming
economic growth rate of 6.3 per cent.

r Solomon Ouna, an engineer, was two years into his
〇〇〇

Railways Corporation (KRC) and had
already adjusted to the lackadaisical
life in Lundha village in Siaya County
when the call came through. It was
towards the end of 2006.
An election year was fast approaching and President Mwai Kibaki’s
Party of National Unity (PNU), whose
campaign platform was infrastructure
development, was facing a massive
challenge from the opposition.
Sheltam Railways, a consortium
led by South African Roy Puffet, had
convinced Kenya and Uganda to cede
railway operations to them for 25
years. But there was a problem.
Rift Valley Railways (RVR) — as
Sheltam called itself after merging
with Transcentury, a company owned
by influential people close to President
Mwai Kibaki — could not raise the
required $24 million (Sh2.4 billion)
equity in order to close the deal.
As a result, the signing of the concession was pushed back from January
2006 to the end of October 2006. It
was in the midst of this delay and the
realisation that RVR could not turn
around railway operations in Uganda
and Kenya that both countries agreed
in principle to build a standard gauge
railway (SGR).
Initial plans envisaged a line from
Mombasa in Kenya to Uganda, Rwanda
and linking to Tanzania and the DRC.
A second line would connect to South
Sudan. Then Uganda developed cold
feet.
It is under these circumstances
that Mr Ouna, now deceased and
who was then 57 years old, received
a call to return to Nairobi. The Kenyan government had decided to go
it alone despite an initial feasibility
study warning that SGR would only
be economically viable if it traverses
the two countries from Mombasa to
Kampala in the first phase.
Mr Ouna was to head a team that
would research and issue an official
proposal to KRC on the new railway.
He did so in two years, but another
problem materialised.
RVR was threatening to scuttle the
whole deal as its concession was just
two years in. Additionally, the government had been unable to procure a
consultant to undertake a preliminary
design of the project.
Unknown to Mr Ouna’s team, even
as they were researching about the
project, brokers had got wind of it
and approached the government
with ideas on how to make the SGR
a reality quickly.
Mr Jimmy Wanjigi, a tycoon and
wheeler-dealer in the shadowy world
of government tenders, had already
formed a relationship with China Road
and Bridge Corporation (CRBC) and
decided to take it upon himself to save
the deal from collapsing.
So influential was Mr Wanjigi that
he is among the people who would,
five years later, help forge an alliance
between Uhuru Kenyatta and William
Ruto to form Jubilee. Mr Wanjigi also
played an almost similar role in the
last General Election in the creation
of the National Super Alliance (Nasa)

〇〇〇


〇〇〇

〇〇〇


〇〇〇


〇〇〇

in connection with the inflation of
land prices along the SGR corridor
together with former National Land
Commision chairman Muhammad
Swazuri, among others.
Mr Swazuri and Mr Maina were,
however, not the first high-profile
people to be burnt courtesy of their
involvement in SGR. The first casualty
was Mr Wanjigi himself.
Immediately after ascending to
power, the Jubilee administration
〇〇〇


identified SGR, which PNU had been
unable to actualise, as a possible legacy project and gave it high priority.
First, Mr Wanjigi’s team was sidelined,
leading to a bitter falling-out between
him and Jubilee.
Then Mr Nduva Muli, who signed
the deals between KRC and CRBC
in 2012, was named Transport principal secretary. Mr Michael Kamau
was brought in to head the ministry.
With SGR in the hands of these two,
President Kenyatta believed they will
deliver the project. Meanwhile, Ms
Kitany, who was also part of the SGR
negotiating team, landed a position
in the Deputy President’s office as
chief of staff.
In a cruel twist of fate, the three —
Ms Kitany, Mr Muli and Mr Kamau
— lost their positions barely two years
into the Jubilee administration. This
is after they appeared on President
Kenyatta’s list of corrupt government
officials presented to Parliament in
2015.
Mr Ouna, the person who conceptualised SGR, died a poor man, leaving
behind a semi-permanent house sitting in the middle of his late father’s
compound in Nyagera village.
The unkempt compound is where he
was buried, next to his father.
His neighbour Mzee Oduor claims
that the late Ouna would routinely
ferry tonnes of building materials to
the village only for them to be carried
off to unknown destinations in trucks.
“We could not understand why he
would do that, because he was deeply
secretive and a very private person,”
he said.

opposition outfit. But in 2008, when
the SGR deal was almost collapsing,
President Kibaki had been forced to
share power with Mr Raila Odinga,
who was prime minister. Mr Wanjigi
walked to the PM’s office and, after
their meeting, the deal was back on
track.
A few weeks later on August 12,
2009, a memorandum of understanding (MoU) was signed between
Transport minister Chirau Ali Mwakwere and CRBC for a feasibility
study. The initial railway line was
500km long and was to be used by
electric locomotives (the current


〇〇〇

line is 609.3km long and is powered
by diesel locomotives). In the MoU,
CRBC agreed to carry out the feasibility study for free. But there was a
rider, and it later turned out to be a
costly mistake.
“CRBC would be the sole agent to
design (engineering, procure and contract), construct and supervise all the
works of the project,” said the MoU.
That MoU effectively sank Kenya into
a hole that subsequent governments
have been unable to get out of. It was
the first mistake in the whole SGR debacle. The road map, however, began
a year before, when a company with a
similar name to CRBC was registered
in Nairobi.
CRBC Kenya, registered by Peter
Maingi Gatere and Leonard Mwangi
Ndungu, was the one that gave the
Chinese leeway into huge Kenyan
government contracts, starting with
SGR. To date, it is not known who Mr
Gatere and Mr Ndungu were, as their
names don’t feature anywhere in SGR
documentation.
Meanwhile, Mr Ouna had been
teamed up with a high-powered team
from Kenya Railways to lead negotiations between the State and CRBC.
This included Finance General Manager Alfred Matheka, Infrastracture
Management General Manager Maxwell Mengich, Procurement Manager
Lucy Njoroge, Head of Legal Stanley
Gitari, Railway Maintenance Manager
David Mwadali and Ms Marianne
Kitany.
Among the concessions they gave
were allowing CRBC to supervise itself, exempting from tax all imported
equipment and materials, non-binding
bills of quantity and barring arbitration in case of disputes relating to
the project from being handled in the
Kenyan legal system.
Mr Matheka and Ms Njoroge resigned in September 2018 after being
demoted from their positions by
Managing Director Atanas Maina in
February of that year. Mr Gitari was
demoted to a legal assistant manager.
Mr Matheka and Ms Njoroge’s resignation came just three weeks after Mr
Maina had been arrested and charged

to the US where they pleaded guilty
to trafficking.
In Mombasa, they had managed
to frustrate efforts by the State to
extradite them through the Judiciary and President Kenyatta now
uses the case to showcase the rot
within the judicial structure, where
he has no control.
Nine months ago, and with the
confidence of a big cat, President
Kenyatta made his biggest move
in the reorganisation of the administrative state and appointed
Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred
Matiang’i as chairperson of a newly
constituted National Development
Implementation and Communication Committee.
The new outfit is mandated to
supervise the execution of government programmes.


**Immense powers**
In the Executive Order, whose
import was not quickly seen, Dr
Matiang’i was to guide a team
composed of all Cabinet secretaries,
the Attorney-General, Mr Kihara
Kariuki, and the Head of Public
Service, Mr Joseph Kinyua.
Another technical team was set
up, chaired by the powerful Interior Principal Secretary Karanja
Kibicho.
The team brings together all the
Principal Secretaries and gives
them immense powers to supervise
government projects.
Already, some governors such
as Murang’a’s Mwangi wa Iria
have been protesting about Water
PS Joseph Irungu’s supervision of
projects in the county — an indicator of the shift in power to the
administration.
Also established under the Executive Order were Regional and
County Development Implementation Committees that are now
chaired by Regional and County
Commissioners in respective jurisdictions.
Under the new guidelines on
standards, procedures and reporting requirements, most of
the information flows through the
administration structures. That is
why the PDU was recently moved
from State House to the Ministry of
Interior, which is now coordinating
“delivery” of all State projects.


**The new Uhuru state**
With a single coordinating ministry, President Kenyatta has been
implementing what is known as
“one-government approach policy” through which the Ministry
of Interior and Coordination of
Government has been working
with other ministries in the implementation of key government
programmes.
As a result, Dr Matiang’i and Dr
Kibicho have become the new faces
of the new Uhuru state.
Some of the programmes carried out under the multi-agency
framework include the delivery of
the Big Four.
But politically, it has managed
to whittle down the relevance of
politicians in the Kenyatta II term.
Also, the former provincial administration has been reorganised
to follow a similar pattern.
In his new role, Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i has
realigned the provincial structure
to meet President Kenyatta’s new
“one government approach policy”.
This structure has been worked
out with new roles assigned to the
regions and counties, which have
been strengthened to reflect the
new thinking.

Police at the Coast are on
high alert over a possible AlShabaab attack a few weeks
after a most wanted terrorist
was killed and another suspected member injured in
raids in Kwale and Mombasa
counties.
Yesterday, police said the
terrorist group is believed to
have sent seven operatives
to Kwale and Kilifi counties
to attack key installations.
An internal communication sent to police
commanders indicates that
some of the targeted installations include Kenya
Ports Authority (KPA), Moi
International Airport and
the Standard Gauge Railway
(SGR) Mombasa terminus.
“It is likely that the
operatives may use the opportunity to target social
places including hotels and
beaches along the Kenyan
Coast,” reads the letter to
the police commanders dated
September 28.
Seven suspected terrorists
who have undergone training
in Somalia are reported to
be planning to access the
country using police and
United Nations branded
vehicles stolen during their
previous raids.
The communication obtained by the _Nation_ and
signed by Kwale police com




learn from the collapse of Punguza Mizigo that did not take into account views
of the ordinary people. Every discussion
(to change the Constitution) should
start with the ordinary mwananchi.
We will not allow a few people sitting
in hotels to change the law.”
This was the first time the DP spoke
publicly about the Punguza Mizigo initiative that seeks to reduce the burden
on taxpayers. He also took issue with
leaders seeking to expand the executive
by creating more positions. He said such
proposals were aimed at benefiting a few
people at the expense of development
and matters affecting the public.


**Leadership positions**
Mr Ruto wondered why the country
is being treated to discussion around
leadership positions meant to benefit
individuals. The ODM leader is on record saying the country must have the
position of Prime Minister while at the
same time rooting for a parliamentary
system of governance.
But the DP said: “We cannot be
speaking about leadership every time.
This will make us look selfish because
we will be avoiding pertinent matters
affecting our people.”
He was in Vihiga to raise funds for
several churches. At the first event held
at Kidundu Stadium in Vihiga Subcounty, he helped raise Sh4.6 million
for eight churches and a Muslim group.

eputy President William Ruto
yesterday maintained his stance
〇〇〇

to amend the Constitution, saying,
politicians pushing for this were only
interested in creating positions for their
selfish gains.
He warned those crusading for the



amendment of the Constitution to
prepare to suffer the same fate as the
Punguza Mizigo (amendment) Bill,
2019, which has so far been rejected
by seven county assemblies.
The bill sponsored by Thirdway
Alliance leader Ekuro Aukot is currently being debated by the 47 county
assemblies and has since been rejected
by MCAs in Nyamira, Siaya, Kirinyaga,
Homa Bay, Murang’a, Kiambu and Kisii.
Uasin Gishu County Assembly, which
is Mr Ruto’s backyard, is the only one
that has so far approved the bill.
The DP, who made the remarks in
Vihiga County at two separate fundraisers for several churches drawn



from Vihiga and Sabatia sub-counties,
appeared to suggest a change of heart
after indications that the Tanga Tanga
group associated with him supported
the Punguza Mizigo initiative.
Another drive seeking to change the
Constitution is the Ugatuzi Initiative
being spearheaded by the Council of
Governors (CoG).
Further, there is speculation that the
Building Bridges Initiative that was
borne after the handshake between
President Kenyatta and ODM leader
Raila Odinga might not propose a referendum to change the Constitution.
But yesterday, Mr Ruto said the defeat of Punguza Mizigo Bill by various
county assemblies should be a wakeup
call to leaders crafting various initiatives to change the Constitution.
He said Punguza Mizigo is collapsing
because it did not take Kenyans’ views
into account. “Leaders should learn
from what is happening to Punguza
Mizigo (in the county assemblies). It
is no longer tenable to use shortcuts to
change the law,” the DP said.
He went on: “They (leaders) should

“Until you confirm the

letter says.
It adds: “Key installations
in your areas including police
stations, colleges, churches,
hotels, beaches and supermarkets to be guarded or
patrolled. Plan and execute
raids on need basis in your
areas.”
The alert came hours after
the National Police Service
(NPS) launched a manhunt
for a suspected Al-Shabaab
terrorist identified as Abdiwaahdi Khalif Abdi alias Ise
Tarabuun.
In its official Twitter handle, the NPS said that the
Somali national is believed
to have arrived on September 24.
Police sources said Mr
Abdi had previously been
arrested over terrorist claims
in Somalia."

The Clerk of the National Assembly Michael Sialai yesterday

circumvent the House’s conditional
approval hence the order sought in
her suit would negate Parliament’s
statutory mandate.
According to Parliament, if given
a go-ahead to take up the post, she
has a likelihood of facing serious
confl ict of interest in advancing
international and national interests
of Kenya against those of the US.
“I believe the allegations made

The High Court has suspended implementation of
guidelines on promotion of
lecturers and other academic
staff in universities.
Justice Weldon Korir issued
the directive in a suit challenging the guidelines created fi ve
years ago which dictated the
manner in which promotions
for lecturers and other academic staff in universities is
to be conducted.
The disputed guidelines
included among other changes
scrapping off the position of
an assistant lecturer.
“Pending the hearing and
determination of this case,
a conservatory order staying
the implementation of the
harmonised criteria and guidelines for the appointment and
promotion of academic staff
in universities in Kenya in
any manner whatsoever,” said
Justice Korir.
The judge issued the temporary order after lawyer Adrian
Kamotho Njenga sued the
Education Cabinet Secretary
and the Commission for University Education (CUE) over
the disputed varsity promotion



never published in the Kenya
Gazette as required by law and
that the sued parties imposed
a mandatory compliance deadline of October 26.
He alleged that the guidelines are discriminatory and
unfavourable to the academic
staff as it scraps the position
of assistant lecturer.
The guidelines dictate that
in determining suitability for
appointment, staff would be
evaluated on the basis of qualifi cation, experience, research,
quality teaching, community
engagement and other contributions.

team tasked with reviewing the skewed contract
〇〇〇

Chinese firm operating the
Sh327 billion standard gauge
railway (SGR) has hit a dead end.
This comes after China Road
and Bridge Corporation (CRBC),
the contractor, refused to provide key information protected
by the confidentiality clauses in
the controversial contract, on the
grounds that it was “sensitive
and private”.
“The negotiation for a review
of the operation and maintenance contract did not progress
because the operator refused to
provide information that would
enable the team to determine
reasonable costs of SGR operations,” a highly placed source
said.
This comes even as Kenya
readies itself to pay the first
Sh25 billion instalment for the
construction and locomotives
loan next month, following the
expiry of the five-year grace
period in line with the May 11,
2014, loan agreement to finance
the jubilee government’s pet





project. Another Sh25 billion
will fall due in June next year.
Kenya has already set aside
Sh35 billion in the supplementary budget to take care of the
repayment to China’s Exim Bank
next month. By the end 2020,
Kenya is expected to have repaid
at least Sh50 billion of the loan.
A multi-agency team was
formed after concerns were



raised on the need to take a
fresh look at various contracts
that had been awarded to CRBC
to ensure that Kenya protected
its interests and assets, as well
as removed any touchy issues.
To revisit the contracts, the
team comprising officials from
the Presidential Delivery Unit,
the Office of the Attorney-General, Kenya Railways, Ministry of
Transport, the National Treasury
and CRBC was set up.
It was led by Transport Principal Secretary Esther Koimett,
whose previous role as Kenya’s
investment secretary and now as
the ministry’s accounting officer
put her in good stead.
But after a number of preparatory meetings, the process
stalled and appears to have been
shelved altogether.
“We asked for data to help
us come up with the regression
analysis formula and inform the
renegotiations, but this was not
provided,” the source said.
Based on the operations
contract, Kenya Railways (KR)
currently owes CRBC over Sh31
billion in fixed and variable costs,
which have to be paid by the
exchequer since the operator
had not been able to break even.
The total debt for the SGR
project in January 2020 will be
over Sh60 billion.
Meanwhile, CRBC claims
that it is becoming increasingly
difficult to continue working
without the payments from
Kenya Railways, and has come



up with measures to sustain its
operations. It has communicated
these measures to KR and the
Ministry of Transport.
As at November 1, the invoiced
amount was $476 million, which
translates to about Sh47.6 billion. Kenya Railways approved
Sh43 billion and so far Sh7.3
billion has been paid.
Kenya Railways is also struggling to pay security fees for
the trains. It is also supposed
to come up with Sh170 million
for insurance premium.
To deal with the cash flow
problems, CRBC says it will
be forced to suspend salaries
for expatriates and insurance

transfer allowance if KR does

the railway line, the acquisition of coaches and operations is heavily skewed against Kenya.



not pay it soon.
CRBC came into the picture
during the Grand Coalition government headed by President
Mwai Kibaki, when some of the
initial contracts were signed. The
firm sought favour with top officials from KR and the Transport
ministry with the blessing of the
Prime Minister’s office.
It was allowed to do a “free”
feasibility study, which turned
out to be the document that set
it apart as the preferred supplier
of almost everything.
After the study, it was awarded
the contract to build the railway
line from Mombasa to Nairobi,
having found a financier back
home. It also bagged the next
contract to procure coaches and
locomotives, known as rolling
stock.
Together with its affiliates,
it got the contract to supervise
the construction, and finally, to
operate and maintain the line.
But CRBC is operating the
trains through its subsidiary,
Africa Star Railway Operation
Company, adding to the confusion over who to deal with.


**Strategic assets**
Trouble started when it
emerged that Kenya could have
exposed its assets, among them
the Mombasa port, as security
for the loan. It also emerged that
the contract was hurriedly drawn
up in a government-to-government deal.
The worst provisions had to
do with security. The contract
put Kenya’s strategic assets
at home and abroad at risk of
being seized by the Chinese
government in the event of a
default. Also, any disputes are
to be governed by Chinese laws.
To operate the trains, CRBC
charges a fixed Sh1.3 billion per
month, or about Sh40 million
daily. It also loads other charges,
known as variable costs, when
it increases trips during peak
seasons or when it does more
than three return trips a day.
“Kenya took the demand risk
and that is why it is our job to
ensure the trains are full while



the CRBC assumed the operations risk,” the source said.
Mid this year, the operator
sent Kenya Railways a fee note
of Sh30 billion in pending payments. It also slapped Kenya
with penalties amounting to
Sh800 million for late repayments of its operation fees.
The contract also frees the
operator of all liability but forces
KR to pay the fixed monthly
service charge, which must be
paid quarterly, and in advance.
“What we need is a formula
that can help determine the
fixed and variable costs. What
we have is an arbitrary fee such
that we cannot work backwards
or accurately use to forecast as
required in any costing model,”
another source said.
A special reserve account with
Sh3 billion to cushion CRBC was
also opened.

〇〇〇


**The amount that must be**
**kept in a reserve account**
**to cushion China Road**
**and Bridge Corporation.**


The contract also made it
imperative to start operations by
June 1, 2017. Any delay would attract a Sh24.2 million fine daily.
The money generated from
ticket sales is deposited in a
reserve bank account, together
with all payments from Kenya
Railways. This must be done
within 24 hours.
“The Operator shall also, as an
agent of KR, manage a system
for collection of non-cash revenue, including payment utilising
the M-Pesa cash transfer platform,” the contract says.
During a live _NTV’_ interview
on December 28 last year,
President Kenyatta promised to
release the SGR contract to put
to rest any _“porojo”_ (rumours)
that the Chinese could seize
the Port of Mombasa if Kenya
defaulted on its payments.
He is yet to do so."

6, 2019, we raised our concerns
regarding the use of NFT for container handling due to structural
design which is limited to break
bulk cargo. However, in your
reply, you have stated that Kenya
Railways shall be indemnified by
Auto Ports against all claims and
or damages that might arise as a
result of such operations at NFT,”
said a KRC letter dated March

22, 2019.
The KRC management did
not immediately respond to our
enquiries over the disposal of the
publicly funded facility. Board
chairman Michael Waweru had
also not responded to our emails
by the time of going to press.
In previous discussions that
gave a glimpse of the intrigues,
KRC board appeared to have been
sharply divided over conditions in
the offer letter, which Autoport
had objected to.
KRC wanted the Joho-linked
firm to acknowledge its ties with
Portlink Logistics Ltd (a firm
that had taken KRC to court
over contractual disputes). The
corporation wanted the case
withdrawn and the land in dispute
returned to KRC. Portlink in 2015
had sued KRC for attempting to
illegally terminate a contract for
a 0.692-acre parcel of land the
former has leased near the Mombasa railway station for 15 years
as from August 1, 2013.
KRC man agers and some
Ministry of Transport officials
believe that both the companies
are linked to the Joho family
and hence saw a chance to deal
with them as one. In January
2016, KRA and KPA suspended
Autoport and another company
known as Portside Freight Termi#### f


nals Ltd over claims of engaging
in tax evasion and smuggling of
goods into the country.
At the time, the Joho family
did not disown ownership of the
two companies. Documents held
〇〇〇


by the registrar of companies
indicate that the three companies indeed do have inter linked
shareholders.
Governor Joho previously criticised the government’s plan
to develop dry ports in Nairobi
and Naivasha to handle the SGR
cargo, maintaining that it wo uld
kill businesses at the Coast but
has since softened his stand.
He has also warmed up to
President Uhuru Kenyatta.

Hassan Joho is poised to finally
take over a cargo terminal in
Nairobi built using public funds
in a controversial deal that
once again puts the spotlight
on the operations of the multibillion-shilling Standard Gauge
Railway (SGR).
Mombasa-based Autoport
Freight Terminals Ltd has for
months been piling pressure
on Kenya Railways Corporation
(KRC) to give it exclusive use
of the Nairobi Freight Terminal
(NFT), near the SGR terminal in
Syokimau, locking out other players who use the new railway cargo
services from the site. Sources at
the Transport ministry indicated
that the Joho family company is
also keen on acquiring a strip of
land between the SGR and the
old metre-gauge railway within
the same area.
Last month, the pressure
culminated in a near confrontation after KRC pulled down a
billboard erected by Autoport at
the NFT even before full approval
was given.
In documents seen by the
_Sunday Nation_, Autoport wants
the NFT to handle its loose or
bulk cargo transportation business on the Mombasa-Nairobi
SGR, giving it a near monopoly
over rivals.
The KRC board eventually succumbed to pressure and asked the
management to allow the Johos
to take over the fully developed
terminal in an opaque deal with
little or no financial value to the
public, according to those familiar


〇〇〇


〇〇〇


〇〇〇

with the matter.
This was despite concerns by
the Kenya Revenue Authority
(KRA) that the private firm had
intended to use the NFT for purposes outside those for which it
was designed.

Sh500 million was envisaged to
pay for itself mainly through the
transportation of bulk cargo (also
referred as loose cargo) such as
cement, fertiliser, steel, clinker
and grains, among others.
The initial approval by the KRC
board for Autoport to use the NFT
was in September 2018, before
the matter stalled later after the
_Sunday Natio_ _n_ exclusively broke
the story.
The NFT deal for Autoport was
passed during KRC’s 410 [th ] Special
Board Meeting on September 26,
2018, where the board approved
Autoport’s application to lease
26 acres out of the total 36 at the
NFT for a period of 45 years as
from December 1, 2018.
The logistics company was
meant to pay a stand premium of
Sh78 million, exclusive annual rent
of Sh19.5 million, an application
fee of Sh5,000, pegging fees of
Sh50,000, three months security
deposit of Sh4.88 million and ad

〇〇〇

ministrative charges of Sh100,000
– all totalling Sh103 million.
KRC is said to have fallen back
to its earlier condition to Autoport
that other agencies also needed to
give consent for the firm to begin
loading cargo from the facility,
which also has a close-to-2km
SGR siding.
While the Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) seemed to have given
its nod, the next hurdle has been
the KRA, whose officials have
been under intense pressure to
yield to the deal.
The Mombasa-based logistics

late March seeking a no-objection
to start operating the NFT. Autoport claime d there was no other
government agency objecting to
the deal that had also set them
a target to handle two million
tonnes of cargo every year.
“I wish to urgently seek your
no objection letter to facilitate us
to load our cleared cargo from
the port so that the same will be
transferred to our facility (Nairobi
Freight Terminal) by SGR. Kindly
take note that the NFT has been
leased to Autoport Freight Terminals Limited for 45 years and
the lease monies have been paid
in full,” the firm wrote to KRA.
The firm argued that the deal
would be helpful in decongesting
the nearby Inland Container Deport if allowed to run the facility
under the four-decade lease.
Although it remains unclear
whether KRA had responded directly to the Mombasa-based firm,
sources within Times Tower said
the agency was concerned that the
NFT was not designed for containerised cargo, compounding
the same fears Kenya Railways
had after Autoport wrote to notify
them of its intentions to start
loading containers at the NFT and
even asking them to notify KRA
for “smooth operations”.
KRC, which signed the offer
dated November 2018 giving
Autoport a 45-year lease for land
measuring about 26 acres, began
to change tune in late March 2019
after investigations into the deal
started, with the top railways
officials choosing to distance
themselves from liabilities that
may result from putting the facility into a purpose for which it
was not built.
Autoport was also asked to
ensure it got all the other relevant
approvals as a condition for its
no-objection letter.

The _Sunday Nation_ has also

Although KRC offered the
firm a lucrative 45-year lease for
the facility in November 2018,
our sources say railway officials
developed cold feet after the
deal raised eyebrows, attracting
attention the of the investigative
agencies.
“The initial plan was that KRC
runs the facility but questions
began to emerge after it was
given out to Autoport and investigations began with the DCI
being involved. That place is very
strategic given its location,” an
insider source said in confidence.
Autoport had previously also
asked for preferential rates to
carry cargo over the SGR but
the fate of this request is unclear.
Although such cargo only
accounts for two per cent of the

The Ethics and Anti-Corruption
Commission and the National Land
Commission have established a joint
valuation team to end the stalemate
arising from compensating families
affected by the construction of the Nairobi-Naivasha section of the standard
gauge railway.
Buildings have been torn down in
Nkoroi, Kajiado County, to pave the
way for the railway.
China Communications Construction Company (CCCC), which is
building the railway, stopped work on
the 120-kilometre stretch in Empaash,
Tuala, Oloosirkon, Milimani, Rankau,
Kandisi, Merisho, Nkoroi, Kangawa,
Oloolua, Ngong, Kimuka and Suswa following disagreements on compensation.
The EACC also got involved when
huge variations were reported in the
compensation.
NLC acting chief executive Kabale
Tache yesterday said the two agencies are concerned about the delay in
compensating families affected by the
railway and are working to ensure the
issue is resolved within a week.
“We have been meeting and we hope
to get a solution soon,” Ms Tache said.
She was speaking when Transport
and Infrastructure Cabinet Secretary
James Macharia and other senior government officials appeared before the
Senate Committee on Transport.
The minister had been called to
respond to a petition by Nkoroi residents complaining about delays in
compensation even after their houses
were demolished.
Mr Macharia told the committee,
chaired by Kiambu Senator Kimani
Wamatangi, that the ministry had
executed its obligations regarding the
construction of the line.
He added that the ministry gave NLC
Sh17 billion to compensate the families
that lost land and other properties.
“The EACC and NLC are independent entities and they should be
invited to explain what happened,” Mr
Macharia said.
EACC got involved after Clarence
Matheny Leadership Training Institute
sued the lands agency for taking long
to process the compensation.
Ms Tache said the EACC carried out
a quick sample on 56 properties out
of 93, which established a 66 percent
variation in their valuation.
Out of these, some 73 properties were
marked out as overvalued.
But there is no order stopping the
payment of compensation, and Ms
Tache told the committee that she is
acting on the side of caution.
“The NLC is keen to ensure payments
are made lawfully and the money goes
to the rightful owners,” she said.

The leaders who gathered to mark
the 50 [th] anniversary of Mr Mboya’s
death noted that the county needs to
reconcile and unite to move ahead with
a common goal.
President Uhuru Kenyatta, in a speech
read on his behalf by Opposition leader

still flow through the nation that he
helped found, noting he is building
bridges of unity in his honour.
“How I wish we could bring back the
country together as it was before. This
is what my brother President Kenyatta
and I are trying to do through the Building Bridges Initiative,” said Mr Odinga.
He added that Mr Mboya captures the

you can do for your country.”
The trade unionist, who orchestrated
student airlifts to the US in the 60s,
believed he had a responsibility to actualise Kenyans’ dreams, regardless of
their ethnicity, said Mr Odinga.
“He lived most of his life in a two-bedroomed house in Ziwani Estate in
Nairobi's Eastlands. He was never an
overnight millionaire and never really
considered himself a hustler,” said the
former prime minister.
In his sermon, Bishop Alfred Kipkoech arap Rotich, stressed the need for
reconciliation, noting that despite the
efforts by the Justice and Reconciliation
Commission of Kenya (TJRC), more
still needs to be done.
The memorial service brought
together various leaders including
Interior CS Fred Matiang’i, Amani
National Congress’s Musalia Muda


vadi, Narc-Kenya’s Martha Karua, CS
for Defence Raychelle Omamo, former
Attorney-General Charles Njonjo, and
senators Amos Wako, Johnson Sakaja,
James Orengo, Fred Outa, and Ochillo
Ayako.
Mr Mboya was gunned down outside
a pharmacy on Tom Mboya Street in
Nairobi on July 5, 1969, which according
to observers was due to ethnicity and
succession wars.
A similar service was held at the
independence hero’s mausoleum in
Kamasengre village, Rusinga Island,
Homa Bay County, where he hailed
from. A three-day celebration is planned
at his home starting tonight as part of
the commemoration.
Construction of a perimeter wall
around his mausoleum and its renovation is going on and is funded by the
National Museums of Kenya.
The renovations will go on for the
next three months. According to the
curator at the mausoleum, Mr Paul
Ndiege, Mr Mboya’s brother, the facility
has been unable to display the entire
collection of the former minister’s artefacts due to security threats.
“The wall will allow us to have control
on those getting into the mausoleum.
It will have an electric fence around it,”
Mr Ndiege explained yesterday.
“There are several artefacts that the
late Mboya used. Some are in the mausoleum while others are kept elsewhere,”
Mr Ndiege said.

An assistant county commissioner in
Bomet County is in the eye of a storm
after it emerged that he had kept 260 litres of chang’aa at his office for a month.
Mr Dominic Olang’, who is in-charge of
Cheptalal division in Konoin sub-county,
also retained seven lotto machines
alongside the illicit brew inside his office.


**Tip from public**
Four empty jerrycans, four drums and
19 copper wires — implements used to



distil changaa — had also been kept by
the administrator.
On Wednesday, police officers, led by
sub-county commander Alex Shikondi,
following a complaint from the public,
went to the administrator’s office and
confirmed the brew was indeed there.
“We have transported the exhibits
from the office to the sub-county police
headquarters for safe keeping,” said Mr
Shikondi in a statement.
The administrator had confiscated the
illicit alcohol during a raid he allegedly
conducted with chiefs and their assis


tants from the area on June 10, but no
explanation was forthcoming as to why
he did not hand it over to the police for
almost one month.


**No suspects**
Exhibits can only be kept at designated areas, including a police station,
Kenya Wildlife Service, Kenya Forestry
Service and Kenya Revenue Authority
offices.
A police post headed by a chief inspector of police is located a few metres
from the administrator’s office.



It has also emerged that no suspect
had been arrested in connection with
the raid and confiscation of the betting
machines, alcohol, drums and other
implements.
County Commissioner Geoffrey
Omoding was unavailable for comment
as he was in a meeting with the regional
police commander Edward Mwamburi,
county commanders and sub-county
commanders from Narok, Kericho and

**SUMMARY**


**Local tourism has**
**rescued the sector**


The kenyan tourism sector has over the years become highly dependent
on international tourists.
Following the outbreak
of the Covid-19 pandemic, travel restrictions
saw the industry explain
a major slump. The loss
of conferencing business
made the situation even
worse. The establishments have so far been
kept afloat by local tourists who have come out
to enjoy the various packages on offer. The vaccination requirement, hoteliers now say, puts their
recovery at risk as it has
already seen a number of
guests cancel thei bookings.



_cluding red, yellow and green_
_listing (of countries according_
_to their Covid-19 infection num-_
_bers) is a concern to the travel in-_
_dustry. If we want the economy_
_and travel to open up, we need_
_to have clarity and justice. We_
_should stop panicking,” he added._
_In Nakuru County, players in the_
_hospitality industry are reaping_
_big from conference tourism._
_According to Nakuru County_
_Tourism Association chairman_
_David Mwangi, 75 per cent of cur-_
_rent bookings are primarily on_
_conferencing. This was due to_
_the lifting of the Covid-19 restric-_
_tions, with both government and_
_corporate entities holding meet-_
_ings there._
_“Walk to any of the hotels with-_
_in Naivasha and you will real-_
_ise conference facilities are ful-_
_ly booked. A clear testimony that_
_the industry is opening up,” said_
_Mr Mwangi._
_“A tourism focal point, Naiva-_
_sha is a visitor’s destination and_
_attractive recreational spot both_
_for local and international visi-_
_tors,” he added._
_Christmas bookings, the hotel-_
_ier added, had increased by al-_
_most 30 per cent compared to_
_last year, as he projected 90 per_
_cent booking ahead of the festiv-_
_ities._

_A judge has allowed a prime property at Nai-_
_robi’s 14 Riverside Drive where high-end office_
_suites and the Dusit D2 Hotel stand to be auc-_
_tioned over a Sh5 billion debt._
_Justice Alfred Mabeya dismissed an applica-_
_tion by I&M Bank and its administrator seek-_
_ing to stall the sale arguing that the company_
_that owns the complex owes them $25 million_
_(about Sh2.82 billion)._
_The complex is owned by Cape Holdings Ltd,_
_which has been embroiled in a dispute since_
_2010 over a botched sale deal. Synergy Industrial_
_Credit, which wants to auction the property, had_
_paid Sh750 million to acquire some of the apart-_
_ments but the deal fell through and the matter_
_was referred to an arbitrator. The debt has since_
_ballooned to Sh4.5 billion plus interest._
_The judge ruled that it was not necessary for_
_Synergy, through senior counsel Ahmednasir_
_Abdullahi, to seek the administrator’s consent_
_before applying to be allowed to auction the_
_property._
_Justice Mabeya said the charge placed by the_
_lender was a moratorium for the company to_
_enable it to evade its legal obligations. Syner-_
_gy had placed a caveat through a court order in_
_2011, warning the public over the property._
_“With such a caveat, that property was not free_
_to be given as a security,” the judge said._
_The dispute revolved around a transaction_
_where Synergy bought two of 14 apartments that_
_were under construction and paid Sh750 million_
_upfront. When the property was completed, Cape_
_Holdings refused to transfer the property and the_
_matter was referred to arbitration._
_In 2015, the arbitrator, James Ochieng Odu-_
_ol, ordered the developer to refund the princi-_
_pal amount and interest totalling Sh1.66 billion._
_Cape Holdings then sued in the High Court and_
_convinced the court to quash the award, saying_
_it was erroneous._
_That prompted Synergy to move to the Court_
_of Appeal and the award was restored while at-_
_tempts by Cape Holdings to move to the Su-_
_preme Court and reverse the decision were dis-_
_missed by the apex court._
_In his ruling, the judge said the bank would not_
_suffer prejudice because it has other securities_
_whereas stopping the sale would subject Syner-_
_gy to irreparable loss because its bid to recover_
_the money would be delayed._

resident Uhuru Kenyatta will
find Chinese officials keenly
〇〇〇

lands in Beijing for the Heads of State
Summit of the Forum on China-Africa
Cooperation (FOCAC) just days after
meeting US President Donald Trump
in the US capital.
It has already been confirmed by the
Chinese Ambassador in Nairobi, Sun
Baohong, that President Kenyatta’s
trip to China will include a one-on-one
sitting with host President Xi Jinping.
In the interim, Chinese officials have
been scrambling to decipher the timing
and significance of his Washington trip.
Chinese antennae were raised when
President Kenyatta accepted an invitation to meet President Trump shortly
before departure for a Beijing parley
that had long been on the programme.
He flew west to the US last weekend, meeting President Trump at the
White House on Monday and holding
separate meetings with potential US
investors before flying back home.
Barely getting a rest, he hopped on
an eastward flight to China.
It would probably have been easier
for the president to head directly for
China by continuing a westbound
route from the US, but he had to be
in Nairobi to receive visiting British
Prime Minister Theresa May on her
maiden trip to Africa.
As President Kenyatta was in the
US, international channels on Chinese
State television were interrupting
blanket build-up programmes on the
FOCAC Summit with extensive coverage of his American trip. Apart from the
basic news coverage, a lot of time was
spent on analysis, looking at the trip as
a revival of US interest in Kenya, and
Africa in general, against the backdrop
growing Chinese influence.
Foreign policy and Africa experts
from both Chinese and American institutions were trotted out on screen
to digest President Kenyatta’s White
House visit. They churned out a lot of
data to illustrate how China is rapidly
overhauling the US, and the rest of the
west, as Africa’s premier trade partner.
The analysis highlighted major Chinese infrastructural and development
support projects on the continent,
depicting Africa and China as natural allies, both being in ""developing""
regions. It was clear that Chinese
officialdom was looking with concern
at Mr Kenyatta’s American trip and
was preparing responses in the event
Washington and capitals of former
colonial powers such as London and
Paris moved aggressively to regain
past primacy in Africa.
All that was happening at a time
China was hosting large groups of
African journalists on extensive tours
aimed at building bridges and creating
understanding, under the auspices of
the China International Publishing


〇〇〇

he recent White House meeting
between President Donald Trump
〇〇〇

raised US-Kenya bilateral relations to
new heights, advancing our shared
commitment to prosperity, security,
and good governance. A highlight of the
visit was the launch of our new Strategic
Partnership, which will benefit the people
of both countries.
The US-Kenya friendship extends
beyond our 55 years of diplomatic
relations. Each day, thousands of
Kenyans study, work, tour, and do
business in America. And, each day,
thousands of Americans do the same
in Kenya. Our relations are businessto-business, university-to-university,
NGO-to-NGO, and people-to-people.
The new Strategic Partnership
builds on these historic and personal
connections to make our nations stronger
and our citizens more prosperous. To
realise the benefits of the partnership, we
will hold an annual high-level dialogue
to accelerate our co-operation and create
new opportunities.
Direct flights between Nairobi and
New York City will facilitate these
stronger ties, and ease business links and
investment, academic exchanges, and
family visits. Aeroplanes don’t just carry
cargo, they carry people and their ideas,
energy, and creativity.

Group Training Centre
The Kenyan team of 21 on a threeweek tour flew out in the wake of a
series of negative media reports on
Chinese presence in Kenya. Most
recent were reports on alleged racism
and discrimination in running of the
Standard Gauge Railway; persistent
queries about the cost and viability of
President Kenyatta showcase development project; concerns about Kenya’s
mushrooming debt exposure partly
attributed to China-funded projects;
and a growing number of Chinese
settling down to run small businesses
in Nairobi and other towns.
There have been similar concerns
about Chinese activity in many other
Africa countries, so it might not have
been surprising that at the same time
in Beijing were other media delegations
from Uganda, Ghana, Sudan, Democratic Republic of Congo and many
other countries, some scheduled to stay
on for the FOCAC Summit between
September 3 and 4.
The build-up to FOCAC included
interviews by China Global Television
Network (CGTN), China’s answer
to CNN, BBC and Al Jazeera, with a
host of Beijing-bound African leaders
focusing on their respective countries
and Chinese development support.
One clip replayed over and over
again was when President Kenyatta
— interviewed by CGTN’s Beatrice
Marshall just before his departure for
the US — implicitly criticised President
Trump’s protectionist trade policies.
Chinese officials were clearly excited
by President Kenyatta’s position,
interpreting it as backing for a global
campaign to portray their country as
the champion of free trade, globalisation, international agreements and
environmental protection.
While China would not expect the
newfound African allies to completely
ditch their traditional western partners,
there was evident concern about the
timing of President Kenyatta’s US trip
just before the FOCAC Summit.
This is significant because this is the
first FOCAC gathering since President
Trump started imposing tariffs on
Chinese products entering the US,
triggering a cycle of retaliatory tariffs
and the threat of full-blown trade wars.
Apart from China, an established foe
and rival, the Trump administration


〇〇〇

has extended trade penalties on key
allies in both economic and political
spheres, including neighbouring Canada and a host of European countries.
FOCAC is usually a routine gathering
focused on cementing China-Africa
links, but the forthcoming summit will
naturally become an extension of the
Chinese fightback against American
trade sanctions.
China has already launched a global
offensive to counter the US. Ambassador Sun hosted a rare press briefing
in Nairobi towards the end of July on
Friday to respond to the growing number of controversies around Chinese
activities in Kenya, but a key point of
the agenda was global issues on the
trade wars with the US.


〇〇〇


〇〇〇

The Embassy’s Commercial and
Economic counsellor, Dr Guo Ce,
talked at length on the escalating
trade war with the US, touting China’s credentials as a champion of free
trade, a faithful observer on World
Trade Organisation rules and other
international agreements, including
environmental protection measures
such as the Paris Climate accord that
the US is reneging on.
That is the new China as a leader on
free trade, globalisation, multilateralism and the United Nations Summit
that they will be keen to project to their
FOCAC guests.
So it is likely that other than just
focusing on China-Africa issues, the
Summit will be steered towards expressing solidarity with China on its
tiffs with Washington.
That explains why China has been
assiduously wooing and cultivating
African leaders to win support and
secure a record attendance in Beijing.
The media tours are designed to
showcase China’s emergence as an
economic superpower and key supporter of African development.
To that end, the delegates found a
China that is also keen to listen and
learn how best to manage relations,
not just with African governments and
officialdom, but also with the African

people who have negative perceptions
of the ‘newcomers’.
China officials are attuned to blaming domination of western media
— Reuters, AP, AFP, BBC etc — for bad
press in Africa. They are puzzled that
their own investments in media, such
as CCTV, CGTN, China Daily Africa,
the massive Xinhua News Agency
and Star Times digital TV, are not yet
paying off in terms of helping change
negative perceptions.
One thing they learnt from the media
tour is that instead of blaming western
media, they should focus on re-tuning
their Africa media outlets by providing
news and entertainment that resonate
with the intended audiences.
But the visit also provided eye-opening encounters that could, for some
time, provide captivating stories of
much relevance to Africa.
In China’s ‘poor’ Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region, for instance,
the Kenya team toured an impressive
desert reclamation project where
supposedly sterile desert sand is inchby-inch being made fertile enough to
support crops. Such a project would
surely revolutionise agriculture in
Kenya’s arid and semi-arid lands.
The team also visited a vast network
of underground tunnels in one city
used for power lines, water and sewage
pipes, and telecommunications cables.
The instant reaction was how Nairobi
badly needs such a system to avoid
the nuisance of Kenya Power, Nairobi
Water, Safaricom, Faiba, Telkom and
other utilities and service providers
forever digging up trenches to install
their own pipes and cables.
The media team saw that beyond
the massive government infrastructure
projects or the reputation for cheap
consumer products, there is a lot more
to pick from China. Whether in manufacturing, agriculture, city planning,
environmental conservation, poverty
alleviation, traffic management, commuter transport systems, the list is
endless on what Africa can buy, borrow
or adapt from China.
President Kenyatta and other African
leaders should probably be heading
to Beijing with that kind of focus,
but chances are they will be steered
towards the bigger picture of global
power relations when sometimes it is
the small things that matter.


〇〇〇

During President Kenyatta’s visit,
we also concluded Sh85 billion in
commercial deals and engagements
with the public and private sector, which
will help increase our Sh100 billion
annual bilateral trade. We established
a US-Kenya Trade and Investment
Working Group to deepen our trade
partnership and add to the success
of 18 years of trade expansion under
the African Growth and Opportunity
Act. Doing business with American
companies means quality, transparency,
accountability, and fairness for
employees, investors, and customers.
The commercial deals announced
included plans for a Sh50 billion
project to develop a nationwide digital
information and communications
infrastructure for the Kenyan
Government, with American companies
providing technology and expertise. This
will be the first project under the USKenya Memorandum of Understanding
signed during the June visit of the US
President’s Advisory Council on Doing
Business in Africa. Other announcements
included Boeing’s Sh4.6 billion deal
with Kenya Airways to provide spare
parts and servicing, Kenya Komposites’
Sh1.5 billion investment to establish a
manufacturing facility and Kentegra’s
Sh400 million investment.
The relationship between the United
States and Kenya is built on shared
values and a commitment to true
partnership. Together we can build a
better, more prosperous world for both
Kenyans and Americans.

3 anti-counterfeit

The anti-counterfeit agency

said to have been received a

media post claimed the officers
had received the money as from
a trader in the course of duty at
Marsabit Plaza in Nairobi. AntiCounterfeit Authority executive
director Elema Halake said
that the agency took the step
following information shared
online touching on the integrity

Ms Sarah Wairimu Kamotho was
yesterday charged with the death of

in custody.
Standing calm and composed with
a stripped sweater over her shoulders, Ms Kamotho, who told the
court that she understands English,

The charge sheet stated that
on the night of July 19 and 20, in

Tob Cohen.
Immediately she denied the



charge, her lawyer Philip Murgor

In the application, Ms Kamotho
said she is neither a flight risk nor

She said she voluntarily handed
her passport to the investigating
officers, for purposes of verifying her
travel abroad, when they requested
for it. She also stated that she has

The Pharmacy and Poisons Boards
(PBB) has recalled several batches of
Sure condoms that are distributed for
free by the government, throwing into
question the quality of the products.
Several of the free condoms were
recalled after they failed to pass various quality tests even as the board
maintained that the non-compliance
is batch specific and does not impact
the entire production of the condoms.
The regulator said that it has put in
place mechanisms to ensure quality and
safety of condoms circulating in Kenya
in addition to ordering recalls of all the
impacted batches of the Sure condoms.
“PPB has a robust post-market surveillance system that includes routine
quality surveys, where samples of different medicine and medical devices
categories are collected from different
levels of pharmaceutical outlets and
health facilities, and the samples are
subjected to laboratory analysis to check
the quality of the product. This is done
based on the product specifications
that were applied during registration
of the individual products,” said CEO
Fred Siyoi.


**Requirements**
The batches of Sure condoms and
Sure lubricated condoms dotted, manufactured by HLL Lifecare Ltd in India
and Innolatex Ltd in Thailand, are said
to have holes while others did not pass
the requirements for burst pressure.
“The following batches 17DN754
and 17DN052 failed to comply with
specifications for burst volume and
pressure and freedom from holes test
respectively.
Batches P48045, L48037, P48001,
P48027 failed to comply with specifications from holes test while batches
L48058, L48110 failed to comply with
specifications for quantity of lubricant
test,” PBB said in letters to the manufactures’ local representatives.
Batch number 1601957422 by Suretex
Prophylactics (India) Limited was also
found to be faulty.
Lifeline Laboratories and Population
Services International (PSI) who act on
behalf of the two manufactures have
further been directed to come up with
a recall plan of the faulty condoms.
The expiry date of the affected
batches is between December 2021 and
December 2022.
Reports indicate that it is not the first
time such an incident is taking place.
In 2018, the Health Ministry did order
a recall of some condom brands on the
same grounds.

revoked the directive to haul cargo
direct from Mombasa to Nairobi using
the standard gauge railway (SGR) as
nomination of cargo also resumes in
Mombasa.
This comes after the Mombasa
business community had threatened to
block SGR next week in their planned
protest and abscond Mashujaa Day
celebrations which are scheduled to be
held at Mama Ngina Park if government
had failed to heed to their demands.
Yesterday’s meeting which was
chaired by Interior CS Fred Matiang’i
and his Transport counterpart James
Macharia and attended by different
port stakeholders was a big relief to
thousands of people who have lost their
businesses while others were rendered
jobless by the SGR directive which was
not anchored in any law.

Revenue Authority (KRA) Commissioner, Customs and Border Control
Kevin Safari, Kenya Railways management, Mombasa Governor Hassan
Joho, Kenya International Freight and
Warehousing Association (Kifwa), Container Freight Owners management,
Kenya Transporters members among
others attended the meeting.
According to those who attended, the
resolution was reached after stakeholders presented the recent study by the
University of Nairobi (UoN) indicating
that the economic state of Mombasa
is at ‘economic decay point’ since the
government ordered all cargo be hauled



using railway freight direct from Port of
Mombasa to Nairobi Inland Container
Depot in Nairobi in June this year.
“We agreed anyone can transport
cargo using any mode of transport from
Port of Mombasa to Nairobi. The meeting also resolved that nomination of
cargo can be done in Mombasa depending on the wish of the importer,” said
Mr Roy Mwanthi, the Kifwa chairman.
Nomination of all undocumented
cargo will be done by KPA based on
vessel rotation, volumes and individual
CFS capacity where clients are required
to be informed regarding their cargo on
time. Previous, shipping lines handling
cargo destined to Mombasa were being
nominated by clearing agents on behalf
of their clients.
In the past two weeks, the business
community used the UoN study to base
their protest against government move
to deny transporters and CFSs business
which had crippled trade in Mombasa.
Coast MPs who attended the meeting
include Mohammed Faki (Senator),
MPs Mohamed Ali alias Jicho Pevu
(Nyali), Omari Mwinyi (Changamwe),
Ali Mbogo (Kisauni) and Abdulswamad
Shariff Nassir (Mvita), a team that had
been vocal against the directive.
Mr Joho said he was contended
with the deliberations of the intergovernmental committee and they had
identified areas of interest to be rectified
and modalities put in place to ensure
residents are not denied benefits."

Findings from a study of the pilot

that it is not effective and does not

The findings raise serious questions ahead of a national conference

According to the study, parents,

It actually recommends that the
CBC be discontinued.
“The piloting phase had no

The directive by the Kenya Revenue Authority and Kenya Ports

through newspaper adverts and
is to be implemented from today.
It comes against a backdrop
of opposition from leaders in the
Coast and transport players.
""All imported cargo for delivery

be conveyed by SGR and cleared
at the inland container depot in
Nairobi while cargo intended for
Mombasa and its environs shall be
cleared at the port,"" the directive
by the agencies read.

The House proceeds on a long
recess tomorrow.
More than 20 CFSs have invested about Sh12.5 billion in
the Coast and approximately
800 trucks operate on the Nairobi-Mombasa road daily.



Most of the MPs rallied behind
Mr Shariff, saying if implemented,
the order would lead to a massive
loss of jobs.
“The MPs feel the directive is
misplaced. It was done without
consultations and is not supported
by any law,” Mr Shariff said.

to complete the project to Malaba
as was originally envisioned.
The President, who insisted
the SGR ending in Suswa was
not a ‘railway to nowhere’, said
despite the challenges expected in
continuing the project to Malaba,
the government will ensure the
country gets maximum economic
gains from the project.
Mr Kenyatta had joined other
leaders in the maiden train ride
on the newly completed Section
2B of the SGR project.
He asked Kenyans to be patient
as the government ensures the
project reaches its intended destination. “This is the end of Phase
2A but it is just the beginning of
another phase as we have to ensure
the railway gets to Kisumu and
link to the port as well as continue
the section to Malaba to reach the
other markets as was intended.

for now, may leave Kenya with the
option of borrowing more to real

he six Coast region counties
of Kwale, Mombasa, Kilifi,
〇〇〇

Lamu are all endowed with vast
resources, but not much has been
done to unlock this wealth for the
benefi t of the people.
The collapse of Jumuiya Ya
Kaunti Za Pwani – the proposed
economic bloc for the six counties meant to address the region's
challenges -- is also a pointer to
how deep the region is reeling from
under-development.
In Taita Taveta for instance,
gemstones and other precious
minerals are in abundance but
poverty is still rampant here and
many people are squatters.
Mr Charles Karisa, a senior manager for policy and tax at Deloitte,
says the region has failed on its
priorities, like food security.
“In Kilifi, every time there is
drought, there is a big challenge of
food security but that has not been
well addressed,” he says.
Region governors do not regard
food security as a priority invest


a devolved function.
“You cannot have a county with
people who can’t feed well and
then expect them to work hard
and achieve their development
agenda.,” he said.
The coastal belt is a rich agricultural zone suitable for cash crops
like cashew nuts and coconuts.
Kwale, was once known for a
vibrant cashew nut and coconut
industry, but all that is gone.
This, too, is home to huge titanium reserves, in Msambweni.
However, the crop development
sector here is down on its knees,
and the story of mineral over-exploitation remains just as sad, if
the lamentations of the locals are
anything to go by.
Wananchi in Zigira in Msambweni constituency told the _Nation_
that they will protest against plans
to relocate them to pave way for
exploration of minerals in their
village.
But why are the people poor if
the region is this rich?
Coast failures are believed to
be partly caused by the political
class. In the face of the allure of
rich land and minerals, the region
has remained under-developed,
with leader after leader since independence failing to address the key
challenges facing the population.
As a result, lives have been miserable for the coastal communities,
more than 50 years after Kenya



minent in supporting industries such
as transport and hospitality.
Politicians, sadly, have yet to give
attention to the matter.
In Kilifi, Lamu and Tana River
counties, the major economic activity is fi shing and agriculture but the
collapse of the once-vibrant cashew
nut factory in Kilifi in the early 1990s
spelt doom for the sub-sector, which
subsequently folded.
“With the death of the Kenya
Cashew Nut Factory came the death of
livelihoods for more than 80 per cent
of the residents of Kilifi,” said governor
Amason Kingi when he initiated a
European Union-funded cashew nut
value chain in the county recently.
Voters have been expecting elected
leaders to address these issues, but the
region’s politicians are busy campaigning for the 2022 General Election.
During the homecoming party for
Matuga MP Kassim Tandaza, several
MPs under the banner of the Coast
Parliamentary Group took to the
podium to criticise each other as they
campaigned for their 2022 presidential
preferences.
Changamwe MP Omar Mwinyi,
a close ally of Mr Raila Odinga and
Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho,
hit out at those supporting Deputy
President William Ruto’s 2022 presidential bid.
“You are given seven kilometres of
tarmacked road and then you start
singing about a person,” he said.
That invited a quick reaction from
the DP’s allies, who said the legislator
was on someone’s payroll.

the collapsed sugar sector, bixa and
other failures in the county, but non

In Mombasa, tourism and fi shing
are some of the main economic
pillars of the county, but the poverty rate, especially in marginalised
areas, is worrying, with large areas
going without basic essentials

sanitation.
Cases of locals invading land and
the never-ending squatter problems
have troubled Mombasa for long
and no solution has been found yet.

oast residents have a reason

with Japan for the construction of the
Dongo Kundu Special Economic Zone
(SEZ), which will unlock more than
60,000 jobs.
This now sets the pace for the
compensation of residents, who will
be affected by the project. This also
opens room for lobbying and jostling
for investment opportunities by firms
seeking to reap from the project.
Kenya is expected to sign the a final
print of the Sh41.07 billion deal with
Japan to build the industrial and commercial hub in Dongo Kundu, Mombasa,
in December.
This comes as a win for Mr Hassan
Joho’s administration that has been
vouching for the project as an alternative to the lost port business.
The signing of the deal is good
news for the port town that has been

as fuelling and service stations are

The study showed that Mombasa had
lost more than Sh17.3 billion since the
Standard Gauge Railway came into operation, and the shift of clearance to the
Nairobi Inland Container Deport (ICD).
The Nation has learnt that the final
Memorandum of Understanding was
signed between Kenya and Japan on
the sidelines of the Tokyo International

Mr Joho has been vocal on the execution of the Dongo Kundu Special
Economic Zones as the regions alternative to dwindling fortunes brought
forth by the shift to SGR and the use of
the Nairobi ICD, as the main clearance
hub for goods.
“Dongo Kundu SEZ would create
hundreds of thousands of jobs. As it
is, the port is very dear to us, but I can
tell you, if the SEZ is to happen today,
it would employ 10 times what the port
is currently employing.
“It’s our responsibility as leaders
to ensure this dream is realised,” Mr
Joho said.
The Dongo Kundu SEZ industrial and
commercial hub, expected to sit on 1,326
hectares, is part of the master plan for
the development of the Mombasa SEZ
that was conceived four years ago with
Japanese help.


**Resettlement plan**
Efforts to get a comment from
Transport and Infrastructure Cabinet
Secretary James Macharia on the project
were futile as his calls went unanswered.
However, Kenya Ports Authority
Managing Director Daniel Manduku
confirmed that an MoU was signed. He
noted that KPA would guarantee the
loan as they seek to have the contractor

_The Kenya Transporters Associ-_

_despite President William Ruto’s_
_pledge to ensure they get back_
_their jobs, which had been taken_
_away by the mandatory require-_

_“It is with great consternation_

_the consequence of killing the_

_“The previous administration’s_
_policy to force railing from Mom-_

_al development should be a re-_
_sult of organic growth and the_
_needs of the people. It should also_
_be based on benefi ts derived and_
_the best use of scarce resources_
_available.”_
_Mr Wang’oo said instead of tak-_
_ing loans to extend the SGR to_
_Malaba, the government should_
_build more roads and put in_
_place stringent safety regula-_
_tions._
_“To shift attention to rail on_
_safety grounds is abdicating re-_
_sponsibility to improve the eco-_
_nomic welfare of the people,” said_
_the association chairman._
_He added: “Kenya is current-_
_ly burdened with huge loan re-_
_payments for monies secured to_
_build infrastructure that had no_
_commensurate benefit for the_
_common mwananchi. In some_
_cases, the projects resulted in a_
_negative social impact on the_
_same people they intended to_
_benefi t.”_
_Mr Wang’oo said apart from de-_

_fi ts the government and supports_
_the livelihoods of a vast number_
_of people._
_“From the ordinary person sell-_

case being heard at the Mombasa High
Court has the potential to shake up the
〇〇〇

governments over the control of key economic
institutions and the very foundations of Kenya’s
Constitution.
The case, filed by three petitioners, takes the
fight for the control of the port of Mombasa
from the political arena to the corridors of the
law, and its outcome could have ramifications
for devolution.
Under the Constitution, key institutions
like ports, railways, airports and waterways,
as well as natural resources, are regarded as
national assets, leaving counties to manage
some classes of roads and markets. The case
in Mombasa seeks to review this arrangement
and will be keenly followed by other counties
hosting major State-owned companies like East
African Portland Company (Kajiado), Kenya
Meat Commission (Machakos), hydropower
plants in various counties, and sugar companies
in Western and Nyanza.
The High Court is expected to rule on whether
the petition, which seeks to have the Mombasa









operate the port, will be referred to the Chief
Justice to constitute a five-judge bench to hear
it. Justice Eric Ogola said yesterday he will
deliver the ruling on July 24.
Were the petition to succeed, the county
government of Mombasa would take over
management and operations of the port, which
employs 7,000 people and generated Sh38 billion in revenue last year from handling goods
traded between East Africa, the Great Lakes
region and the rest of the world.
The petitioners, William Ramogi, Asha Omar
and Gerald Kiti, through their lawyer Nyambura
Kihoro, say the case is important for the regu


of Mombasa. “The petition is complex in nature
and raises matters that are of public interest
and of national importance,” said Ms Kihoro.
The petitioners have sued the Attorney-General, the Cabinet Secretary in charge
of Transport and Infrastructure, Kenya Ports
Authority, and Kenya Railways Corporation. All
of them did not oppose the application to have
the CJ constitute a five-judge bench.
The petitioners want an order that the
national government only regulates the port,
leaving the county to manage its operations.
They contend that the county government,
under the Constitution, is vested with powers
to manage local transport, including harbours,
but excluding the regulation of international
and national shipping.
They argue that maritime navigation, which
is reserved for the national government, ends
once a ship docks at the port.
“It is a violation of the Constitution for the
national government not to have devolved
the function of managing and operation of
harbours in relation to transport to the county
government,” the three argue in their petition.
Major ports across the world, they say, are
owned and controlled by port city municipalities
or states in which they are located. According
to the petitioners, KPA and KR have entered
into an agreement which obligates them to
ensure a set volume of cargo is transported
via the Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) to the
Embakasi Inland Container Depot (ICD).
“As a result, the freight and the cargo handling activities ... have been transferred from"

he Kenya Railways Corporation
(KRC) is locked in a stalemate
〇〇〇

Madaraka Express train service over the
management of the ticketing function.
This comes after revelations last year of
suspected fraud that triggered investigations that now appear to have stalled.
Documents seen by the _Sunday Na-_
_tion_ reveal that KRC had in February
recommended that it should assume
greater control of the Standard Gauge



arrangement that blindsides KRC but
is backed by the operations and maintenance contract revealed by the _Sunday_
_Nation_ last month.
In an attempt to stem revenu e leakages
after the suspected fraud, the corporation
had wanted to have more oversight on
the ticketing function but this has stalled
after the Chinese reportedly remained
unresponsive to formal engagements
on the issue.
“KR should put in place a system that
interacts with the operator’s ticketing
system for purposes of monitoring and
reconciliations on a daily basis,” reads
the document signed by board chairman
Michael Waweru.
The move followed a suspected ticketing fraud by staff of the Chinese operator
that was revealed by the _Sunday Nation_ .
Last November, several employees of
Africa Star – among them Chinese and



scheme involved creating refunds for
tickets already issued to passengers on
board for each of the four trips between
Nairobi and Mombasa and channelling
the refunds elsewhere.
Sources say that apart from the ongoing attempted bribery case, investigation
on the other aspects of the alleged complex scam have stalled.
Mr Dai Yunjie, spokesperson for Africa
Star, told the _Sunday Nation_ that his
company has been fully co-operating with
the police throughout the investigation.
“Five of our employees were legally
implicated, two Kenyans and three Chi

KRC faces an uphill task in its bid to
wrest the system from the Chinese as
the SGR Operations and Maintenance
Contract stipulates that the passenger
ticketing function is the responsibility of
the operator as opposed to freight charges
where the responsibility of freight charges
collections lies with KRC.
Further, the document noted, “The

audit of the whole ticketing system to plug
any loopholes that might be exploited by
fraudsters was ordered by KRC.
Further, according to the document
signed by the board chairman, the KRC
management is supposed to “set and
implement minimum revenue targets for
the operator to meet and in default the
operator pays penalties given that the
demand for the SGR passenger services
has been increasing”.
Kenya reportedly pays Sh1 billion every
month to CRBC to run the SGR – a figure
that officials have never commented on.
The new railway, whose second phase of
construction has now reached Naivasha,
operates nine pairs of freight trains and
two pairs of passenger trains between
Mombasa and Nairobi.
“As of July 5, the SGR operator has
transported 3.15 million passengers, over
470,000 TEUs (Twenty-Foot Equivalent
Unit) and has safely operated the Standard Gauge Railway for 765 days,” said Mr
Yunjie in his statement.
The KRC document also sought to determine the revenues lost through abuse
of refunds and any other malpractice that
the audit may reveal and lodge a claim
to the operator for the loss since the
inception of the SGR passenger services
on June 1, 2017.
However, we could not ascertain
whether KRC has computed the loss
incurred since the fraud began.

ajor businesses at the
Coast will be hit hard
〇〇〇

by the government to transfer all
imported cargo from Mombasa
to Nairobi through the Standard
Gauge Railway.
On Friday night, the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) and Kenya
Ports Authority (KPA) said all
imported cargo will be transported
from the port to Nairobi through
the railway starting August 7.
""All imported cargo for delivery
to Nairobi and hinterland shall
be conveyed by SGR and cleared
at the Inland Container Depot in
Nairobi while all cargo intended for
Mombasa and its environs shall be
cleared at the Port of Mombasa,""
read part of the notice to the public.
The move will render hundreds
of employees working in different
Container Freight Stations (CFS)
and clearing and forwarding agents
in Mombasa jobless as more than 85
per cent of cargo would be cleared
in Nairobi.
Different stakeholders in the
industry have protested against
the government's move, saying
the mandatory rule violates the
World Trade Organisation (WTO)
agreement which call for free flow
of cargo by the most cost-effective
means. Kenya is a signatory to
the rules.
Kenya International Freight and
Warehousing Association (Kifwa)



chairman Roy Mwanthi said the
association is set to issue official
complaint to the government to
demonstrate their frustrations.
""The move has killed all CFSs
and is the last nail to the economy
of Mombasa as we expect hundreds
of job losses,"" said Mr Mwanthi.
More than 20 CFSs that have
invested Sh12.5 billion in the region
and over 800 trucks that operate
daily in Mombasa may not get
business if the new directive is
implemented, rendering thousands
jobless. This is in addition to the
lodges and restaurants that depend
on the trucks not only at the C oast,
but in other parts of the country
where truck drivers and conductors
eat and sleep.
Truck owners who have been the
most hit since the introduction of



freight train service over a year
ago have decried loss of business,
with some planning to resell their
trucks.
""My members will lose big in
the SGR project. Drivers, loaders
and turn boys have lost jobs as
most containers are collected in
Embakasi, Nairobi. Majority of
transporters will now be forced to
move out of Mombasa as business
here is no longer viable,"" said
Kenya Transport Association chief
operations officer Mercy Ireri.
Ms Ireri said SGR has brought
a curse to the secto r with conventional cargo owners in East
Africa complaining of the delay of
their cargo deliveries compared
to when they were being ferried
using trucks.
""The process of clearance at ICD
in Nairobi has become tiresome
and complex since they are yet to
streamline the services hence it
takes more days for clients to get
their cargo in Uganda as compared
to when it is transported using

trucks from Mombasa. It takes at
least two-and-a-half days to deliver
cargo to Uganda using trucks but
due to complex process at ICD, it
can take more than five days for
goods to reach the country,"" said
Ms Ireri.
SGR, a flagship project of the
Kenya V ision 2030, has been billed
as the biggest transport infrastructure project in the country's history
and is expected to haul close to
nine million tonnes of cargo using
railway to make a profit of Sh5.08
billion in a year, averaging Sh424
million earnings per month.
This is compared to 990,488
tonnes carried in the first year
where SGR made a loss of close
to Sh10 billion.
According to statistics, since the
introduction of 100 per cent exhook railage in May this year, KPA
dispatches at least 10 SGR cargo
trains carrying more than 1,000
containers to Nairobi every day.
In January, they recorded 214
trains, February 172, March 184



while in April and May 203 trains
which transported cargo to Nairobi
while June recorded the highest
performance of an average of 13
trains per day.
Most of the cargo transported
from Mombasa according to records were hides, french beans,
coffee and empty containers
which has boosted the volumes
transported.
KPA managing director Daniel
Manduku said for the first six
months, KPA has been carrying
an average of eight trains per day
from the Mombasa port to the ICD
in Embakasi pushing its revenue
to more tha n Sh50 billion in the
month of July.
""The authority's half-year report
on cargo evacuation showed that
1,197 trains transported cargo to
Nairobi and the efficiency at the
port has seen increased revenue
collection hitting Sh50 billion in
July. We have never collected such
revenue since the authority was
established,"" said Mr Manduku.

Lebanese construction firm Zakhem’s controversy-ridden association
with Kenya Pipeline Company (KPC)
has been capped with the tax agency
narrowing on it over Sh17.9 billion in
unpaid taxes.
The High Court on Wednesday
ruled in favour of the Kenya Revenue
Authority (KRA) to stop KPC from
paying the Lebanese firm Sh7.8 billion
that was pending from the Sh48.8
billion contract for the construction of
the 450-kilometre Mombasa-Nairobi
pipeline.
Justice Margaret Muigai of Commercial & Tax Division ruled that
KRA could be exposed if KPC was
allowed to pay the balance of the contract sum before an appeal by Zakhem
against the Sh17.9 billion the taxman
is demanding from them is heard and
determined.
“Of importance since the dispute
entails tax remittance and there is
possibility of funds transfer pending
the hearing and determination of the
appeal the balance of convenience
tilts to withholding the secured sum
until hearing and determination of the



appeal,” the judge stated in her ruling.
The appeal against the sum of Sh17.9
billion is still pending before the Tax
Appeals Tribunal. In a statement, KRA
sounded upbeat about the ruling.
“Section 42 of the Tax Procedures
Act allows the KRA, where reasonable
grounds exist pointing to the possibility that the taxpayer will not pay
the tax by the due date, by notice in
writing require a person who owes
money to the taxpayer, to pay the
amount specified in the notice to the
KRA,” KRA Commissioner for Legal
Services & Board Coordination Paul
Matuku said in the statement.


**Priority**
According to Mr Matuku, the appeal
pending before the Tribunal must now
be heard on a priority basis as ordered
by the court.
“The Kenya Revenue Authority
(KRA) is demanding Sh17.9 billion
in taxes from Zakhem International
Construction Limited (ZIC), a company incorporated under the laws of
the Republic of Cyprus with offices
in Beirut, Lebanon,” said Mr Matuku.
The unpaid taxes consist of corporation tax, Pay as You Earn, withholding,



income tax and value added tax (VAT)
covering 2014 to 2016. Zakhem had in
July 2014 won Sh48.5 billion contract





at KPC to lay a new pipeline from
Mombasa to Nairobi to replace the
company’s ageing line.
But the contract has been a subject
of several controversies which started
as soon as the award was made with
some rival bidders unsuccessfully
appealing the award before the Public
Procurement Regulatory Authority’s
(PPRA’s) review board.
In implementation of the contract,
the Lebanese firm had promised to
complete the work in 18 months.
However, four years down the line,
only 220 kilometres of the pipeline
has been completed.
Also controversial has been the additional Sh4.4 billion that Zakhem was
demanding from KPC for operational
delays reportedly occasioned by lapses
on the part of the project consultant
Shengli Engineering and Consulting
Company Ltd, changes to design and
delays by the National Treasury in
releasing funds to finance the project.
The award of the tender to Zakhem
and the execution of the project is
currently the subject of investigations
amid allegations of the cost having
been inflated by up to at least Sh2.7
billion."

inance Cabinet Secretary
Ukur Yatani has made bold
〇〇〇

the government to live within its

means.
In his first budget, the Cabinet
secretary appears to have reversed
the trend of avaricious expenditure
after he cut total spending for the
first time in five years.
Mr Yatani reveals in the 2020
budget policy statement that he
intends to present a Sh2.7 trillion
budget for the financial year that
begins in July. This is a reduction
of more than Sh120 billion.
The statement sets out the broad
strategic priorities and policy goals
that guide the national and county
governments in preparing their
budgets for the financial year and
over the medium term.
The 2020 statement is the document that outlines the basis for
the 2020/21 budget.
However, Sh2.7 trillion is still not
a small figure going by the East African standards and the ambitious
revenue targets he has given the
Kenya Revenue Authority.
With Sh2.7 trillion, the country
can build the Mombasa-Nairobi
standard gauge railway eight times.
With this kind of money, Kenya
can construct at least 85 Thika
superhighways and still be left
with change.
If it were to be divided equally
among the 47.5 million Kenyans,
every citizen would walk away with
at least Sh57,000.
Mr Yatani projects that the taxman can be pushed to collect an
extra Sh89.8 billion in the 2020/21

_tract referred to KPA as a borrower_
_and not the government of Kenya._
_“A reading of the agreement lef_
_no doubt that KPA and KRC were_
_borrowers and therefore liable to_
_repay the loan through their assets_
_without immunity. This put the as-_
_sets of KPA at risk in the event of a_

_Phase I of the SGR project in-_

_The 120 kilometre extension to Na-_

_The audit by the Office of Audi-_

_government’s move to make_
_public the standard gauge_
〇〇〇

_agreement, with details of the col-_
_lateral Kenya put up, which a par-_
_liamentary committee had high-_
_lighted, being a key issue._
_Roads, Transport and Public_
_Works Cabinet Secretary Kipchum-_
_ba Murkomen had promised to_
_make public the highly secretive_
_SGR contract during his vetting, but_
_the three documents he released to_
_the public had no details of the col-_
_lateral._
_A parliamentary committee last_
_year said in a report that Kenya_
_had used Kenya Railways Corpora-_
_tion (KRC) and Kenya Ports Author-_
_ity (KPA) as collateral in the Sh477_
_billion SGR loan procured from the_
_Export and Import (Exim) Bank of_
_China._
_Immediately Mr Murkomen_
_shared the document claiming it to_
_be the SGR contract, city lawyer Ah-_
_mednasir Abdullahi posted on his_
_Twitter account: “This isn’t the SGR_
_contract. This is one of the fi nance_
_agreements. The SGR contract is dy-_
_namite ... you won’t see it easily ...”_
_Another city lawyer, Donald Kip-_
_korir, posted on his Twitter ac-_
_count: “True disclosure of SGR_
_contracts are those of manage-_



_ment and commission involving_
_Kenya Railways, China Road and_
_Bridge Corporation and Africa_
_Star Railway Operations Company._
_These are the contracts where bil-_
_lions went to ... other contracts are_
_red-herrings and hot air.”_
_The 24th report of the Public In-_
_vestments Committee (PIC) of the_
_National Assembly on the audit-_
_ed accounts of the country’s state_
_corporations, among them KRC_
_and KPA, which was adopted by the_
_12th Parliament, noted that it re-_
_quested the Attorney-General and_
_National Treasury to make availa-_
_ble the SGR contract without suc-_

_cess._


**Requisite approvals**

_It noted that the two state cor-_
_porations had their assets used as_
_collateral in the Payment Arrange-_
_ment Agreement (PAA) between_
_them and Exim Bank of China for_
_the loan. The signing of the PAA_
_was done without the requisite ap-_
_provals of the KPA board, Ministry_
_of Transport and the Cabinet._
_This saw PIC recommend that the_
_Ethics and Anti-Corruption Com-_
_mission should investigate the_

A cargo train makes its way to the Port of Mombasa on December 14, 2021. The construction of the

_agreement was signed. It further_
_notes that it was inconceivable that_
_KPA could sign an agreement with_
_the KRC agreeing to provide a cer-_
_tain tonnage of goods for transport_
_through the SGR and be held liable_
_in the event of failure._
_This is notwithstanding that as a_
_free-market economy, transporters_
_were at liberty to use any mode of_
_transport, including road._
_“It was not clear to the committee_
_what KPA stood to gain by entering_
_into such an agreement,” the PIC re-_
_port states, even as data from both_
_KPA and KRC indicated that the re-_
_quired tonnage had not been met_
_thus requiring KPA to pay the loan_
_through KRC._
_“The agreement substantively_
_meant that KPA’s revenue would_
_be used to pay the Government of_
_Kenya’s debt to China Exim bank if_
_the minimum volumes required_
_for consignment were not met,” the_
_auditors warned._
_The auditors further warned that_
_KPA’s assets were exposed to risk of_
_takeover by the Exim Bank of Chi-_
_na since it signed the PAA._
_In December 2018, at State House_
_in Mombasa, former President Ken-_
_yatta promised to make public the_
_SGR contract. Following the com-_
_ments, the Chinese government_
_opposed the disclosure. Chinese_
_Ambassador to Kenya Wu Peng_
_said that Chinese laws are against_
_making such contracts public as it_
_would be detrimental to Chinese_
_commercial interests even as he_
_said that no Kenyan assets were_
_attached as collateral for the SGR_
_loans._


**A right to know**
_In May, Justice John Mativo ruled_
_that Kenyans have a right to know_
_the assets used as collateral in se-_
_curing the SGR loans in a petition_
_fi led by Muslims for Human Rights._
_But the government did not obey_
_the court order to make the con-_
_tract public._
_In December 2017, the Sri Lan-_
_kan government lost its Hamban-_
_tota port to China for a lease peri-_
_od of 99 years af er failing to show_
_commitment in the payment of bil-_
_lions of dollars in loans owed to the_
_Asian giant._
_The transfer, according to the_
_New York Times, gave China con-_
_trol of the territory just a few hun-_
_dred miles off the shores of rival In-_
_dia and a strategic foothold along_
_a critical commercial and military_

f _waterway._

_“The case is also one of the ex-_
_amples of China’s ambitious use_
_of loans and aid to gain infl uence_
_around the world – and of its will-_
_ingness to play hardball to collect,”_
_stated the New York Times of De-_
_cember 12, 2017._
_In September 2018, Zambia lost_
_its international airport to China_
_over debt repayment._
_The Auditor-General had also_
_noted that the terms of the PAA_
_were unfavourable to the govern-_
_ment, KRC and KPA in terms of dis-_
_pute resolution. This is because all_
_disputes are to be referred to the_
_China International Economic and_
_Trade Arbitration Commission as_

_each arbitration award shall be fi -_

_into between the railway operator_

_ers of the railway (including, with-_
_out limitation, the Kenya Ports Au-_
_thority), in form and substance rea-_
_sonably satisfactory to the lender,”_
_Section 1.26 of the loan agreement_
_states. This means that KRC and_
_KPA cannot enter deals with other_
_parties that may hurt China’s inter-_
_ests, and that anything that is likely_
_to compromise the collateral must_
_be approved by China._
_The PIC report noted that KPA’s_
_response that the agreement did_
_not include KPA and KRC could not_

f _be sustained “as the contract itself_

_had clear words terming the KPA_
_and KRC as borrowers and that_
_they should not claim immuni-_
_ty”. The committee observed that_
_the drafters of the long-term ser-_
_vice agreement “should have fore-_
_seen this and clarifi ed in the agree-_
_ment if KPA’s explanation was to be_
_believed”._
_“The committee recommends_
_that the National Treasury should_
_renegotiate the entire payment ar-_
_rangement agreement with a view_
_to discharging the KPA from the_
_contract and replace it with the_
_KRC,” the PIC report reads._
_The PIC report reveals that al-_
_though KPA indicated that it began_
_disclosing information relating to_
_the loan payment agreement with_
_KRC in 2020, this ought to have_
_been disclosed from the time the_



_for audit verification during the_
_2022/2023 audit cycle. It is not clear_
_whether this has been complied_
_with._
_The payment agreement shows_
_that KPA’s revenue and assets had_
_expressly guaranteed the repay-_
_ment of the loan, with the auditors_
_saying it is a material fact which_
_had not been disclosed in its fi nan-_
_cial statements for the year ended_
_June 30, 2018._
_When KPA management ap-_
_peared before the committee, it_
_said: “Clause 17.5 must be read_
_within the context of the entire_

_payment arrangement agreement_
_for the Mombasa-Nairobi SGR pro-_
_ject.”_


**Sovereign immunity**
_“From the outset, the agreement_
_described the Government of the_
_Republic of Kenya as the borrow-_
_er. KPA was not a borrower as it did_
_not have capacity to hold sovereign_
_authority and therefore could not_
_plead sovereign immunity. Only_
_the government had such capacity,”_
_the KRC management had told the_
_committee. “The clause could not_
_be enforced against KPA. This was_
_a mistake apparent on the face of_
_the record.”_
_In the documents released by Mr_
_Murkomen, there was no specifi c_
_mention of the collateral, but claus-_

_Over 15 doctors employed by the Kilifi County gov-_
_ernment have been away from duty for the past_
_five years while receiving their full salary, Governor_
_Gideon Mung’aro has claimed._
_The governor has ordered the doctors to return to_
_work within two weeks or face dismissal. Speaking_
_at Mabayanyundo in Kaloleni Constituency, the gov-_
_ernor said the doctors had gone for further studies_
_but never returned after they completed._
_“I am giving them two weeks to resume duty, or_
_they lose their jobs. They should refund public mon-_
_ey for the five years,” he said, adding that many doc-_



_tors were to study for three years and resume their_
_duties immediately._
_Mr Mung’aro said all doctors sponsored by the_
_county government to further their studies would_
_sign a contract that will see them serve the devolved_
_unit for at least three-year before moving._


**‘Waste our money’**
_“There is no way we will waste our money to spon-_
_sor your studies and then you quit the job to work in_
_other places because you have acquired more skills,_
_leaving the people of Kilifi to suffer. We will have to_
_recover our money first, or gives us cash before you_
_go,” he said._

**BY VINCENT ACHUKA**


_mong the very first red flags_
_that the standard gauge rail-_
_way (SGR) project was to be bull-_
〇〇〇

_despite its huge economic ramifica-_
_tions was the exclusion of key players_
_in government from its planning._
_For a project of its magnitude, public_
_participation would have been a nat-_
_ural pre-requisite, considering that_
_the government had to acquire large_
_tracts of land and the railway would_
_cut through towns and villages, affect-_
_ing many livelihoods._
_The National Environment Man-_
_agement Authority (Nema) excluded_
_the Kenya Wildlife Service, Kenya For-_
_est Service and the National Museums_
_of Kenya from the environmental im-_
_pact assessment based on which the_
_project was cleared. This despite the_
_fact that the three statutory agencies_
_manage the Tsavo National Park and_
_other spaces that would be affected by_
_the project._
_The assessment by the Africa Waste_
_and Environmental Centre in October_
_2012 paved the way for the construc-_
_tion of Kenya’s most expensive infra-_
_structure project._
_Besides the secrecy around the en-_
_vironmental impact assessment, the_
_Kenyan government sidestepped the_
_constitutional requirement of com-_
_petitive bidding for all public pro-_
_curement engagements. Instead, fash-_
_ioning it as a “government to govern-_
_ment” deal with China, the contracts_
_were signed exclusively by Treasury_
_and companies owned by the Chinese_
_government._
_China Roads and Bridges Corpora-_
_tion (CRBC), the firm that conducted a_
_feasibility study and affirmed the pro-_
_ject’s financial viability, also did the_
_construction work, provided rolling_
_stock, supervised itself and is currently_
_operating trains at a huge loss through_
_its subsidiary._
_China Exim Bank, which loaned Ken-_
_ya the money to construct the SGR,_
_did not deposit a single cent into the_
_Consolidated Account as expected for_



_all government projects. Instead, the_
_bank was depositing the money di-_
_rectly to CRBC’s accounts._
_“The buyer shall pay those amounts_
_due to the seller which are financed by_
_the financial institutions of China to_
_the seller directly through the finan-_
_cial institutions in China,” says one of_
_the commercial contracts that Trans-_
_port Cabinet Secretary Kipchumba_
_Murkomen failed to disclose._
_“For the amounts due to the seller,_
_which are co-financed by the govern-_
_ment of Kenya, the buyer shall pay di-_
_rectly to the Kenya local bank of the_
_seller,” states the contract._
_However, movement of money since_
_the project began was one way; from_
_Kenyan taxpayers to China. The tax-_
_payers are currently paying Sh1 billion_
_per month for operating trains on the_
_SGR while still repaying Sh96.70 bil-_
_lion per year to the China Exim Bank._
_Kenyans are therefore paying dearly_
_for mistakes committed by public of-_
_ficials who went ahead with a project_
_that they knew was not viable._
_The Kenya Institute for Public Pol-_
_icy Research and Analysis, a govern-_
_ment think tank, had warned that_
_since the SGR would be a single track_
_for both passenger and cargo freight,_

**IN NUMBERS** _it could run only 12 trains a day. This_

_meant that after factoring the time_

**Low cargo numbers** _needed for trains to pass each other,_

_the SGR could run only four passenger_
_and eight cargo trains per day, which_
_would translate to about eight mil-_
_lion tonnes a year, making it difficult_
_to break even._
_However, brokers keen on pushing_
_the project through contracted CRBC_
_to conduct its own feasibility study, ig-_
_noring the government’s own advice._
_The CRBC study termed the project_
_“highly profitable”, conveniently indi-_

Tonnes per year that Kippra _cating it was capable of transporting_

to carry. This advice was _Based on this rate, CRBC argued that_
disregarded after CRBC in- _the Mombasa-Nairobi leg of the SGR_
dicated the railway would _would not only break even, but would_
be able to transport 22 mil- _also repay the loans within 10 years,_
lion tonnes per year _obviating the need to extend the line_

_to Kampala as originally envisaged._
_However, the SGR’s inability to break_



_spares necessary for the after-sale ser-_
_vices and personal items brought into_
_Kenya by the technical team of the sell-_
_er shall be free from any taxes and du-_
_ties,” it further states._
_A study of the bill of quantities also_
_shows a serious exaggeration of pric-_
_es, which raises questions on how the_
_government allowed itself to be rail-_
_roaded into such an expensive project._
_For instance, out of the Sh327 billion_
_that was spent on the project, a stag-_
_gering Sh1 billion was spent on plant-_
_ing grass and another Sh1.4 billion on_
_a chain-link fence._
_The contractor then charged_

_A retired police officer was on_
_Wednesday morning charged_
_with concealing critical evidence_
_and lying under oath, leading to_
_the acquittal of a fraud suspect._
_Mr Reuben Musiba Tambaa,_
_who was attached to the Kisu-_
_mu Central Police Station, was_
_charged with perjury and ob-_
_struction of justice._
_Appearing before Chief Magis-_
_trate Teresa Odera, Mr Tambaa_
_was accused of withholding key_
_evidence in a land case involv-_
_ing a German, Mr Rudolf George_
_Marquardt, and a Kenyan wom-_
_an, Ms Valery Jimoi Khazalwa._
_The court heard that, on Sep-_
_tember 20, 2017, at the Chief_
_Magistrate’s Court in Kisumu_
_East Sub-county, while under_
_oath, Mr Tambaa knowingly gave_
_false testimony touching on a_
_matter that was material to a_
_pending case._
_“You lied that you requested_
_original title deeds from Rudolf_
_George Marquardt, but he told_
_you that they were held in Ger-_
_many in custody of a bank, some-_
_thing you knew to be untrue,”_
_read the charge sheet._
_On diverse dates between 2014_
_and 2017, Mr Tambaa is accused_
_of obstructing justice by failing to_
_collect and present enough evi-_
_dence before a court of law._
_“The accused's actions led to_
_the acquittal of the suspect, Ms_
_Khazalwa, under Section 210 of_
_the Criminal Procedure Code,”_
_read the charge. Mr Tambaa was_
_arrested on Tuesday evening_
_and held at the Kisumu Central_
_Police Station before being ar-_
_raigned the following day, while_
_Ms Khazalwa is still at large._
_Mr Tambaa, 65, denied the two_
_charges and, through his law-_
_yer, Mr Richard Onsongo, plead-_
_ed for leniency because of his ad-_
_vanced age and asked for a cash_
_bail of Sh15,000. The court grant-_
_ed the accused a Sh30,000 cash_
_bail with an option of a bond of_
_Sh50,000. The case will be men-_

ix giant cranes installed at the port
of Mombasa to improve the load### S ing and unloading of containers on

the Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) have
never worked since they were brought
in two years ago at a cost of Sh2 billion,
the _Sunday Nation_ can reveal.
The rai l-mounted cranes at Port
Reitz were bought by the China Road
and Bridge Corporation as part of
the controversial SGR operations
and maintenance contract to handle
cargo on the Mombasa-Nairobi SGR.
However, according to sources at the
port, the massive equipment malfunctioned before breaking down and being
abandoned by the contractor. CRBC
built and operates the Chinese-funded
SGR, which is Kenya’s single largest
investment.
Investigations by the _Sunday Na-_
_tion_ reveal that the SGR operations
at the port now largely depend on the
rubber-tyred gantry cranes and those
owned by the Kenya Ports Authority
with little or no explanation on why
the multi-billion-shillings investment
is sitting idle.
Even more puzzling is that CRBC ap

〇〇〇

pears to have ignored communication
from the Kenya Railways Corporation
(KRC) to ensure that the cranes are
either replaced or put in use. Each of
the cranes cost Sh355 million, a figure
that has also raised questions.
A port official who was present when
the cranes were first tested, but who
spoke in confidence, said they dropped
the containers and appeared out of
control, raising safety concerns.
“CRBC was asked to fix the problem. They brought in experts from
China who failed to resolve the issue.
They seemed to have given up and
abandoned them,” said our source at
the port.
Despite tests and inspections by
China Hoisting and Conveying Equipment Quality Supervision Centre, the
suppliers, in the presence of CRBC and
KRC representatives in mid-October
last year, the cranes have still not
been put to use, putting into doubt
the viability of this investment at the
expense of the taxpayer.
Documents seen by the _Sunday Na-_


〇〇〇

_tion_ reveal that in December last year,
KRC asked the Chinese SGR operator
to ensure the six mounted cranes were
in use. The Chinese appeared to have
ignored the instructions prompting
a letter in January this year to CRBC
general manager for operation Li Jiuping with similar demands that has
also not been responded to.


**Efficiency**
Yesterday, Mr Sandy Feng, a CRBC
communications official, said the company was not in a position to address
the issues raised over the usage of the
cranes and referred us to KRC.
“We appreciate your concerns over
this matter and the operation of the
SGR. However, as for the question you
have raised, we suggest that you reach
out to Kenya Railways Corporation to
get much of the information you are
seeking,” Mr Feng said despite indications in our enquiry that his company
was responsible for the procurement
and operations of the cranes.
KRC did not immediately respond
to the questions redirected to them.
However, Transport Cabinet Secretary
James Macharia admitted that the
cranes have never been used due to
their operational challenges, adding
that the country should expect new
cranes in the next few months.
“The cranes will be replaced by
CRBC. We had a meeting with them on
Thursday and that was the agreement.
The first two cranes are expected to be
replaced in the next few weeks. I am
made to understand that their shipment has already started. Eventually,
we shall get new replacements for the
six,” Mr Macharia told _Sunday Nation_ .

From these loading zones, the cranes
are used to load the bloc trains. Without

then we would not be able to attain

Top Chinese diplomats in Nairobi were
replaced in an apparent bid to protect the
image of their country in Kenya, following
negative publicity over the Standard Gauge
Railway scandal.
Officially, Beijing says the changes, as
those elsewhere, were routine but the _Sun-_
_day Nation_ learnt the Embassy in Nairobi
also started implementing a new policy
that would see the new diplomats engage
the public on social media.
Sources who spoke to the _Sunday Nation_
last week on condition of anonymity say
the new decision, a contradiction from
back home where authorities clamp down
on western social media, is informed by
local realities in Kenya.
The Chinese Embassy, one of the oldest
diplomatic missions in Kenya, also serves
as ‘regional headquatres’ for Chinese affairs
in the East and Central Africa region.
Traditionally, the Chinese officials have
been guarded, often ignoring media requests altogether or giving delayed updates.
Faced with negative publicity about
mounting debt and alleged maltreatment
of workers at Chinese-run firms, Beijing
authorised diplomats to take on critics as
they come, using social media.
First, the diplomats themselves had to


〇〇〇

be changed. The first victim was Head of
Mission, Ms Sun Baohong, who was quietly
but swiftly ordered to return to Beijing for
'redeployment'.
Ms Sun, who had been ambassador in
Ghana, had arrived in Nairobi to replace Dr
Liu Xianfa, only six months earlier. Her first
task was to manage the crisis of the SGR,
after operator China Road and Bridge was
accused of segregating workers, a charge
they deny to date. But she struggled, a
Chinese official privy to the details told
the _Sunday Nation_ .
She was withdrawn in December. Mr
Wang Peng, a former politician in the
Chinese Province of Hainan and a onetime senior information official in their
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, was brought in
two months later to replace her. Mr Wang
had been ambassador to Sierra Leone
since 2016, according to a biographical
note publicised by the Chinese Embassy.
Under instructions to shore up the
Embassy and his government’s rating, he
tripped initially, receiving a reprimand
from the Kenyan government. A diplomat at the Kenyan Foreign ministry said
he ‘began working’ before presenting his
credentials in March, making tours around
the country and giving interviews. In diplomatic tradition, envoys start conducting
official functions once their credentials are

Kenya Railways Corporation (KRC) chairman Michael
Waweru appeared before the
Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) detectives this
week to shed light on questions
about contracts and conflict of
interest.
Apart from Mr Waweru, four
other directors also went to the
DCI headquarters on Kiambu
Road on Wednesday and Thursday, according to a police source
who spoke in confidence.
The enquiries are linked to
possible conflict of interest,
contracts awarded by the corporation, and leasing of property.
Yesterday, Mr Waweru declined to speak about what he
told the detectives.
DCI boss George Kinoti was
also not available for comment
to clarify if those who appeared
were required to record statements. But our sources at DCI
said one of the issues Mr Waweru
was questioned about was possible conflict of interest arising out
of his chairmanship of Zamara
Ltd (formerly Alexander Forbes),
which manages KRC’s pension

accepted (unless a special exemption is
given) by the sovereign, who in this case
is the President of Kenya.
Yet this indicated the new modus operandi of the diplomat. He ordered the
creation of the Twitter handle @Chinesekenya which detailed events of the
ambassador, China’s focus in Kenya and
Africa as well as issuing press statements
to issues touching on China.
Was this always coming? Ms Seraphine
Kiambuthi, a scholar of international
relations and frequent commentator on
China-Africa issues says it is no longer
possible to communicate with the world
while ignoring social media.
For Beijing though, guarding their image
is attached to their ambitions in Africa,
which has been heavily criticised in both
Western mainstream and social media
platforms, argued Prof Peter Kagwanja,
CEO of the Africa Policy Institute.
“They need more than CGTN (the China
Global Television Network channel). This
adoption tells you that China is determined
to defend their status and investments in
Africa,” he said.
Chinese scholar, Dr Peixin Cao, who
teaches at the Communications University
of China in Beijing, told the _Sunday Na-_
_tion_ world’s realities could be influencing
officials.

are also under scrutiny.
Mr Waweru confirmed to this
publication two weeks ago that
he has been the chairman of
Zamara Ltd long before he was
appointed to chair the Kenya
Railway board in June last year.
He denied any wrongdoing.
Wrangles have also rocked the
institution over an unsuccessful
resolution last month by a section
of the board, led by Mr Waweru,
to remove the acting MD, Mr

declined to endorse the move

〇〇〇

**phase of the railway. It didn’t happen and**
**the government later said the issue was**
**not on the agenda. At what stage was that**
**funding dropped from the agenda?**
I really don’t know where those expectations came from. Funding for
Naivasha-Kisumu SGR was not on the
agenda. The Kenya government is focused
on operations of Mombasa-Nairobi SGR.
This is a smart and responsible move from
your government.



**SGR was from inception planned to**
**extend across the Uganda border and**
**maybe even to serve Rwanda and DR**
**Congo. Might terminating at Naivasha kill**
**the project vision and make it less viable?**


China supports Kenyan efforts to improve
infrastructure connectivity. This is of vital
importance to economic development. In
the annex of joint communiqué of the leaders’ roundtable from the recent Belt and
Road Forum, Northern Corridor in Africa
linking Mombasa to countries of the Great
Lakes region and Trans-Africa highway is
included. However, Rome was not built in a
day. I believe SGR will not stop in Naivasha.


**Does that mean you will eventually fund**
**extension to Kisumu and beyond?**
Of course China fully respects Kenya’s
opinion and decision on when to start
Naivasha-Kisumu line. We believe SGR is
economically viable. Note that in first year
of operations, Mombasa-Nairobi SGR has
earned Sh10.33 billion, which is close to
the operating cost of Sh12 billion. It’s never
easy for a railway project to achieve nearly







break-even in a year. Kenyan and Chinese
operators deserve credit for that achievement. China has full confidence in Kenya’s
ability to make profits from SGR.


**Kenyans have been concerned that the**
**deals with China on SGR financing have**
**not been made public. Would secrecy**
**clauses raise suspicion that that there is**
**something to hide? Would China object to**
**the documents being made public?**
Let me declare this: There is no secret
between the Chinese and Kenyan governments. Any loan agreements between
China and Kenya are in line with international practice. None of Kenyan
national assets has been mortgaged for
the SGR loan and neither would any
national asset be seized or controlled
by China, even in a situation of default.


**There have been fears that in the**
**event of Kenya defaulting on the**
**loans, key assets like Kenya Ports**
**Authority and Kenya Railways**
**Corporation could be seized.**
These assumptions are groundless and I don’t think Kenya will
default. Sometimes I think we
should have common sense.
Kenya is a sovereign state.
Any asset in your country is
protected by international
law and should be respected
by other countries. These are
unnecessary worries.


**There is debate in Kenya**
**about the trade imbalance**

**between the two countries.**
**Any concrete steps on how**
**this can be redressed?**
This is a sensitive issue that
raises concerns. It’s important to point
out that Kenya-China trade is determined
by markets. The economic situation and
industrial structure of each country
influences the imbalance.
We do not pursue trade surplus with
Kenya as policy. China’s total foreign
trade in 2018 reached $4.62 trillion,
of which China-Kenya trade volume

Just three weeks after presenting his credentials to President Uhuru Kenyatta, newly-arrived
Chinese ambassador Wu Peng was on a plane
heading back to Beijing for the Second Belt and
Road Forum, a major international gathering
which is becoming a core element of China’s
efforts to spread its tentacles across the globe.
President Kenyatta and opposition leader
Raila Odinga were also Beijing-bound, and by
then Mr Wu must have been scratching his
head trying to make sense of the complexities
of Kenyan politics.
The President and his principal foe working
together and effectively freezing out Deputy
President William Ruto must have presented
quite a puzzle.
The ambassador would have been additionally
mystified by news just ahead of the April 23
departure to the effect that President Kenyatta
and Mr Odinga were headed to Beijing to secure
the stalled Sh368 billion funding for the Naivasha-Kisumu phase Standard Gauge Railway.
The reports were attributed to Mr Odinga,
who told a gathering in Kisumu that he would



be accompanying the President to China for
that purpose. The two leaders leaving China
empty-handed on conclusion of the BRI Forum
naturally attracted its own headlines given the
SGR funding hype. This provoked an angry riposte from State House, which denied funding
for the railway was ever on the agenda.
“It is important to note that the question
of funding for the extension of the Standard
Gauge Railway from Naivasha to Kisumu was
not on the agenda of the meeting between the
two presidents,” said State House Chief of Staff
Nzioka Waita in a statement on April 27.
“It therefore follows that the President cannot
be said to be returning home empty-handed for
something he did not request,” he said, describing
headline as “misleading and extremely damaging
to the reputation of the people and the Government of the Republic of Kenya.”
Mr Waita went on to detail other positive
outcomes from the Beijing visit, including an
agreement allowing export of frozen avocados
to China, a deal for construction of expressway
from Jomo Kenyatta International Airport to



Westlands, and a financing agreement for construction of the Konza Technopolis Data Center
and IT infrastructure.
While affirming Kenya’s continued commitment for extension of the SGR to Kisumu and
onwards to the Uganda border, Mr Waita was
silent on timelines and possible source of funds,
only saying that negotiations involved many
countries and could take several years.


**Regional transport artery**
He blamed media reporting, but did not refer
to the original public statement from Mr Odinga
on which the contentious reports were based.
He was also silent on why and when continued
SGR funding was dropped from Kenya-China
engagements despite the fact the new railway
was from inception designed to stretch across
the country to the Uganda border, where it becomes part of a regional transport artery serving
Rwanda and eastern Congo.
These are some of the issues the _Daily Nation_
tried to tease out of the new Chinese ambassador in an exclusive interview. Mr Wu reiterated



China’s support for SGR as an essential regional
transport corridor, and responded to sceptics on
its economic viability. He hinted that funding
for the remaining phase might still be availed at
some future date, but would not be drawn into
exactly why the matter remains in abeyance.
The ambassador preferred to dwell on the
successes of the complete Mombsa-Nairobi
section of the railway, expressing confidence that
it will soon break even financially and begin to
pay for itself despite critics who dismiss it as a
costly white elephant.
The Chinese envoy hinted that it was a Kenyan
decision not to seek the funding, hailing as wise
and pragmatic the ‘Plan B’ option to terminate
at Naivasha for now and instead rehabilitate the
old railway to take up continue the transport of
cargo and passengers from Naivasa to Kisumu
and to the Uganda border at Malaba.
It is since emerging that this move announced
by Transport and Infrastructure Cabinet Secretary James Macharia may be stillborn as the old
track is damaged beyond repair.

any different from other years.
Many Kenyans deserve the fun
after a long year and those that are
not rushing upcountry will most
likely be making their way to the
coastal beaches in Mombasa and
Malindi, or to the Maasai Mara,
Naivasha and other spread-out
tourist attraction sites in the
country.
Many of the passengers and the
shoppers the _Sunday Nation_ spoke
to said this festive season seemed
happier as there is no tension like
last year when Kenya was reeling
from the shock of two consecutive
general elections.
“The environment is conducive
this year. There were very many
uncertainties, politically and economically, at a similar period last
year,” said Ms Stella Nyaguthi, a
hawker at the busy Tea Room bus
terminus in Nairobi.
Hotels, airlines and supermarkets have, as usual, continued to
convince Kenyans to spend some
more cash. In the majority of the
towns, most shops you come
across have the words “sale” or
“Christmas offer”.
A surge in bookings for the Madaraka Express, popularly known
as the Standard Gauge Railway
(SGR) train, between Nairobi and
Mombasa, has also been reported.
The largest bank by assets
— Kenya Commercial Bank —
appears to have drawn on the fact
that Kenyans are spenders and

announced zero per cent interest
rate on loans acquired through the
micro-lending app KCB-Mpesa if
repaid on the same day.
The _Sunday Nation_ has established that local airlines are busy
in the countdown to Christmas
with record high bookings.
Airlines that spoke to us said
chances of getting an economy
class ticket, which is the cheapest
from Nairobi to Mombasa, were
slim. The ones available require
deeper pockets.
Kenya Airways on Twitter announced last-minute deals to or
from Mombasa on selected dates
this December.



Prices of air tickets have significantly gone up in the past one
month as more passengers seek
to travel by air. Those who have
been booking from last week are
paying almost double the price,
compared with travellers who
booked in November.
And, for the first time, the
cost of flights to Kisumu ahead
of Christmas overtook those on
the Mombasa route on increased
demand.
Those travelling to Kisumu
from Nairobi on Jambojet will
pay Sh14,500 on December 21,
the highest at the weekend, to
Christmas day.



The highest price on Jambojet
to Mombasa from Nairobi over
the period is Sh11,500 and will
reduce to a low of Sh4,500 on
December 24.
Passengers travelling to the
lakeside city ordinarily would
pay Sh4,500 and Sh6,500 for a
one-way ticket.
The cost on all routes will come
down on Christmas day as the
number of those seeking to travel
reduces significantly.
Major shopping outlets have
slashed their prices ahead of the
busy Sunday and Monday, hoping
to cash in on the prevailing shopping mood.

_Silent night, holy night!_
_All is calm, all is bright_

_Round yon virgin mother and child_
_Holy Infant so tender and mild_
_Sleep in heavenly peace_
_Sleep in heavenly peace_


If there is one song that has come to
define Yuletide, then _Silent Night_ is it.
At the risk of sounding sacrilegious, I
have always posited that the writers of
the song might have missed the mark.
For one, some historical scholars have
told us that both Joseph and Mary were
quite young by the time Jesus was being
born. So my argument has always been
that when you have two most likely
scared first-time parents sleeping in a
livestock pen and waiting for the birth
of their first child, silence could hardly
have factored in. In my view, it must
have been quite chaotic.
The same chaos many have imported
into their celebration of Christmas.
Many hardly take a moment to reflect
what the occasion is all about. Instead,
Christmas has been turned into one
large marketing fair, a sort of shopping
mall if you would.
Merchants keen on cashing in on
the occasion give spectacular offers to



shoppers while revelry is the order of
the day. Woe unto you if you do not have
the financial muscle to shop till you drop
dead, as the adverts normally tell us.
However, it is not a recent phenomenon. Writing in _Christianity Today_,
W. David O. Taylor, assistant professor
of theology and culture at Fuller Theological Seminary, says that even way
back in 17th century, Puritans in New
England, USA, had raised concern over
the raunchy celebrations. They then
declared it illegal to celebrate the feast.
“They did so because, for one, the
feast of Christmas involved a great deal
of intemperate behaviour. During these
long winter nights, people feasted in
excess, got drunk, engaged in wanton
sex, rioted in the streets, and barged
into the homes of the well-to-do and
demanded that they be given the best
of the pantry.”
Talking to Kenyans from different
walks of life, the general agreement
seems that Christmas is a pagan ritual
that has no place in Christianity. Journalist Gordon Opiyo says: “I belong
to the school of thought that believes
Christmas should be celebrated as any
other secular holiday like Jamhuri or
Labour Day. It is wrong to make it look
like a spiritual holiday for Christians.
It is misleading to tell people that the
day is the date of birth of Jesus.”
Political activist Jerome Ogola seems

event at a school in Chennai on December 5, 2018.



to agree with Opiyo. He states: ""We are
known to spend a fortune, at times a
whole year's savings, to fund a one-day
excitement, because it is a tradition. As
much as there is a near consensus that
it isn't cited anywhere in the Bible that
Jesus was born on December 25, no one
is willing to change their thoughts about
celebrating the day, giving commerce
an opportunity to thrive in the tradition
founded on religion.”
But there are the believers. One such
is theologian Rebecca McLaughlin.



Writing in a blog for women in _Chris-_
_tianity Today_, she gives compelling
reasons why we should believe in the
Christmas miracle and the miraculous
birth. She says: ""At one level, the miraculous conception of a human baby is but
a drop in the ocean. What’s incredible
about the incarnation is not so much
that a virgin conceived (remarkable
though that might be) but that God
became man.”
“What is truly amazing about the
Christian faith,” says the physicist



Jonathan Feng, “is the idea that God
made the universe — from quarks to
galaxies — but at the same time cared
enough about us to be born as a human
being, to come down, to die and be
crucified in the person of Jesus, and
to bring forgiveness and new life to
broken people.”
Dianne Mhando, a Kenyan Christian,
agrees that there has been a lot of
mammon influence around Christmas
but hastens to add that all is not lost.
“Christmas has been commercialised,
but true Christians do what's right in
private,” she says.
However, PR practitioner Fred Gori
disagrees. He declares: ""Christmas is
a pagan holiday. Jesus was not born
on December 25. At least there is no
evidence to that effect. So, whether
it is commercialised or not, is of little
significance.”
Theologian McLaughlin, on her part,
maintains: It’s a common misconception that the gospel accounts of Jesus’
life were written down so long after the
events they record that the figure they
describe has been mythologised. The
story goes like this: Jesus started as a
great preacher with some groundbreaking ethical ideas, but over the years,
exaggerated claims crept in. A virgin
birth here, a resurrection there, and
voila! the prophet of Nazareth becomes
the Son of God.”"

as happened in the multi-billion-shilling Standard Gauge

A ministry official, who is said to
have blamed the team for “planning
too much”, reportedly teamed up
with a KRC technical consultant to
come up with a sweet coated proposal on the trains whose technical
assessment had not been done and
operational plan in Nairobi had not
been ascertained.
A seemingly clueless Cabinet
even went ahead in a memo dated
December 5 instructing Treasury
Cabinet Secretary Henry Rotich to
allocate Sh10 billion to upgrade the
commuter rail infrastructure, buy
the DMUs and the high capacity
buses.
The greenlight was also given for
the acquisition of the 11 DMUs from
Serveis Ferroviaries de Mallorca
(SFM) of Spain at a negotiated price
capped at $15 million, raising more
questions on whether it was still a
government-to-government deal.
The team which was meant to
conduct a study tour in Spain was
reportedly impressed by a presentation by the Spanish train operator

25 years — in the Sh10 billion plan
for a commuter train service and
high capacity buses in Nairobi, the
Sunday Nation can reveal.
The reconditioned Diesel Multiple Units (DMUs) are expected to
arrive in the country any time from
June this year in a rushed plan that
raises suspicions on just how they
are going to operate given findings
of a report that questions their low
capacity, weaker engines and in Nairobi’s single-track railway system.
Details of the purchase plan
contained in a report released last
month by two global consultants
commissioned by Kenya Railways
Corporation have remained a
carefully covered secret with only
superficial references made to the
public.
The Sunday Nation has since
learnt that the deal is now at an
advanced stage, pushed by influential Transport ministry officials
despite operational challenges being
pointed out.
The team handling the matter
first convinced the Cabinet to approve a government-to-government
deal with Spain, effectively insulating the plan from procurement
scrutiny.
Senior government officials
including Transport Cabinet Secretary James Macharia and principal
secretaries Charles Hinga and
Esther Koimett have kept off commenting on the procurement of
the units as old as 25 years, amid
concerns that taxpayers may get
a raw deal.
In the deal, a single train is priced
at between Sh71 million and Sh137
million (without spares or any
upgrade).
A benchmarking tour to Spain
by a team of 11 officials drawn
from KRC, the World Bank and the
ministry, led by Ms Koimett and Mr
Hinga in September 2018, is said to
have marked a major turning point
in what is increasingly appearing to
be a bad deal.
Kenya had just completed a yearlong study funded by the World
Bank on how to decongest its capital
city through mass movement of
people in and out of Nairobi.
The report, which had detailed
vital prerequisites for a long-term
plan to make commuter trains and
high capacity buses attractive to
private car owners, specified the
types of trains, capacity, routes
and the frequency that would be
able to handle the city’s bulging
population. There was even a “quick
win” component of the report with
a specific work plan.
“All that was no longer relevant
after the trip to Spain. Some
ministry officials even separated
themselves from the rest of the
delegation and began making calls
back in Kenya, just two days after we
had a presentation from the Spanish train operator in Barcelona,” a
source who was in the September
6 to 15 trip confided to the Sunday
Nation.
Two weeks after the trip to Barcelona, which was not meant to
shop for trains in the first place —
according to the programme seen
by the Sunday Nation — the Cabinet
approved the decision to purchase
the trains.
This was hinged on a government-to-government procurement
arrangement with Spain, bypassing

running of the trains.
The used units will also require
substantial provision of spares,
according to the consultant’s report
which also recommended changes
to the KRC workshops to meet the
wheel profile of the trains.
The operation instructions as well
as signs will have to be translated
to English, suggesting the need for
a Spanish workforce.
Of even greater concern is how
the DMUs are far from what the
World Bank-sponsored study had
recommended — essentially making
the units a challenge to operate in
Nairobi.
The team had recommended an
upgrade of existing railway infrastructure first, construction of new
stations and higher capacity trains
than what is being procured.
There was also a requirement
that a Commuter Rail Unit with
marketing, project management
and functional communication
departments be set up first.
First, the Spanish DMUs can
only comprise a maximum of three
coaches with each carrying 128
seated and 130 standing passengers
at full capacity. That at maximum
coupling of coaches, the trains can
only carry 774 passengers.
A study concluded in December
2018 had estimated the number of
passengers to be ferried per day
at 132,000, assuming 60 per cent
vehicle occupancy. At full occupancy
the number would hit 220,000
passengers per day.
After a thorough demand analysis
of the five commuter train corridors
in Nairobi, the team recommended
eight trains with eight-car set DMUs
to make round trips to and from
town to meet the demand. Each
car was envisioned to carry at least
200 passengers.
Syokimau, Thika and Kikuyu
would each require two trains while
the currently dormant Kitengela and
Embakasi Village line would require
one train each. The trains would
make 81 round trips to effectively
pull the peak passenger demands



to and from the city centre.
The eight-car set coach formation was based on the single-track
nature of the commuter rail line
which cannot allow for various
exchanges along the route as it is
in Spain where several tracks allow
the small capacity trains to shuttle
several trips and exchange with one
another along the way.
In fact, in the Nairobi rail set up,
all the lines except for the Kikuyu
one pass through Makadara, making
a bottleneck that experts say should
allow a maximised use through a
high capacity commuter train.
“The DMUs we are buying have
an engine horsepower of 310Kv
which is way lower than the current
engines.
“You need about 1450Kv to pull
1,300 people at once as we had
envisioned in the master plan.
Nobody is looking into this. The
rush is to have them here as soon
as possible while clearly it will not
work,” the railway engineer told the
_Sunday Nation._
Mr Hinga told the Sunday Nation details on how the plan will
work can only be revealed after its
completion.
“We are in the process of procurement and contracting so a whole lot
of the details you are asking for will
be provided once these processes
are complete,” he said.
KRC had not responded to our
queries on the operational practicality of the commuter trains being
bought from Spain — more than
two weeks after promising to give

answers.
Last month, CS Macharia wrote
to all ministry departments calling for a coordinated approach to
provide an “orderly and structured
development of the mass transit
system within Nairobi.”
In the memo, the Nairobi Metropolitan Area Transport Authority
(NAMATA), an overseer unit that
falls under Ps Hinga’s docket, was
curiously given procurement powers
in what is said to have caused jitters
within the Ministry’s ranks.



officials, leaving out the newest
one, with one of the units said to be
completely dilapidated, according
to an insider with knowledge of
the deal.
The Spanish railway operator had
not honoured its pledge to respond
to questions by the Sunday Nation
sent two weeks ago despite committing to do so via e-mail.
“Unit no. 3 (61.19-62.04-61.20)
is in quite bad condition and it
would require a deep refurbishment
process. Unit no. 12 (61.45-62.0661.46) is the newest one and it is
not confirmed that it is included in
the package,” the consultants wrote.
A KRC expert familiar with the
deal and who did not want to be
quoted for fear of victimisation
from his employer said a third visit
showed that only four of the units
were in proper condition.
He was also concerned that there

enya risks defaulting
on its debt obligations
〇〇〇
rent appetite for borrowing
remains unchecked, a think
tank has warned.
Worrying details on the
country’s debt have emerged
a day after President Uhuru
Kenyatta and ODM leader
Raila Odinga left the country
for China to secure a fresh
Sh368 billion loan for expanding the standard gauge
railway (SGR) to Kisumu.
A survey by the Institute
of Economic Affairs (IEA)
revealed that if the country’s
appetite for borrowing continues, it risks defaulting on
repayment in 10 years.
The IEA showed a trend
where the government has
been using more than two
thirds of its revenue to cater
for recurrent expenditure
since 2013, while the money
used to service debts in


creases every year. Of the
money used on recurrent
expenditure in the fi nancial
year 2013/14, 44 per cent went
to service debts.
In 2018/19 that amount rose
to 58 per cent, as money used
to pay wages shrank by seven
per cent. By last year the
government was using over
Sh870 billion of its budget
to pay debts, up from Sh649
billion in the fi nancial year
2017/18 and Sh417 billion
in 2016/17. The amount has
been rising since 2013, when
it stood at Sh331 billion.
In total, the government
spent Sh962.56 billion of
its budget on mandatory
payments, the money drawn
from the consolidated fund.


**Harsh loan terms**

Experts from IEA also
noted that Kenya has been
borrowing from China, whose
loan terms are harsh and
which does not do due diligence studies before issuing
loans, as opposed to Western
countries, which are strict on
how a country governs itself
before approving lending.
“Loans from China accrue
more interest and require
a shorter time to service as
opposed to bodies such as
the World Bank or the International Monetary Fund,”

The Treasury has responded to the
special report on the Eurobond, which
saw the Auditor-General clear the loan
but raised a fresh scandal.
Treasury Principal Secretary Kamau
Thugge told the _Nation_ that he was
happy that Auditor-General Edward
Ouko had vindicated their position on
the Eurobond billions.
But on the revelation that Kenya
spent a whopping Sh725 billion outside
the government’s expenditure platform
— the Integrated Financial Management
System (Ifmis) — the Treasury said the
spending had already been audited and
cleared by the same auditor in the past
and so it is a “non-issue”.
“Are you suggesting that because
some ministries were not on Ifmis so
the Auditor-General could not audit
them? That is plainly incorrect. He
audits all those institutions every year
so the Ifmis issue is a non-issue,” Mr
Thugge said.
He added that the bigger story for the
country was that “no Eurobond money
went missing as had been alleged”.
The _Nation_ broke the story this week
on the fi ndings of the special audit on
the loan whose expenditure puzzle
has remained a battleground between



the government and its auditor. The
report revealed just why Kenyans may
never know what exactly the 2014 loan
was used for after six ministries that
received part of the billions spent the
money outside the Ifmis system.
The system is a government expenditure platform that was expected to
bring transparency and stop leakages
in expenditure.
In his report, Mr Ouko confi rmed
that indeed all the Sh280 billion borrowed was received after paying off a
syndicated loan of Sh53.2 billion and
other transaction fees.
But the money “came into one pot”
and was mixed with the rest of government money, which was sent to various
ministries as approved in the budget.
However, the audit noted that utilisation of Eurobond proceeds could not be
traced to specifi c development projects.
According to Mr Ouko, the Treasury
explained that the funds were fungible,
went into one pot — the National Exchequer Accounts at the Central Bank
of Kenya — and therefore are not identifi able to any particular infrastructure
project.
This is where his audit went cold. His
13-page report has now been dispatched
to Parliament. The report said that
mixing the money with other funds



and sending it in bulk to ministries
that expended it outside Ifmis made it
impossible for his team to track every
coin to its fi nal usage. The report is
dated April 2019.
In 2014/2015, these entities spent a
whopping Sh725 billion outside Ifmis,



part of which was money from the
Eurobond. Some of the ministries and
government departments that spent
money outside the platform are the
Ministry of Defence (Sh80.1 billion),
the National Intelligence Service
(Sh19.2 billion), the Teachers Service
Commission (S170.9 billion), public
debt (Sh416.2 billion), pension (Sh35.2
billion), and salaries and allowances for
the Treasury (Sh3.4 billion).
“Based on the understanding that
expenditure is initiated by the user
through the budgetary and appropriation process, the special audit noted that
these expenditures — especially for the
Ministry of Defence and the National
Intelligence Service — were under the
rubric of confi dential expenditure as
they were utilised outside of the Ifmis,”
the report says.
Mr Ouko recommends that future
international sovereign bonds be
earmarked for specifi c development
projects.
Last week, the _Nation_ broke the story
of how investigators returned home
empty-handed, leaving them with no
choice but to give the process a clean
bill of health.
Clearing the Eurobond is a sigh of
relief for Treasury bosses, who are
preparing to go to the fi nancial markets



for a third Eurobond. Mr Ouko notes
that at the global level, records of government receipts at the CBK reconciled
with records of the National Exchequer
Accounts at the Treasury. The report
says the Treasury fi rst raised Sh200
billion through the international sovereign bond. The second tranche was
a principal amount of Sh150 billion.
But from the gross amount of Sh200
billion, the receiving bank deducted
Sh100 million to pay for legal fees, legal
lead managers’ fees, and roadshow and
other transaction expenses associated
with the initial issue.
Six months after the initial issue, the
Treasury returned to the debt market
for a top-up, known as the tap sale,
raising an additional Sh75 billion.
On securing the second loan, the
government booked a premium of Sh6.5
billion that added up to Sh81.5 billion.
Collectively, the two loans now
amounted to Sh281.5 billion. This loan
was known as the Eurobond.
JP Morgan Chase, Bank of New York
and Citibank New York were the receiving banks for the Eurobond proceeds
in the initial issue.
When the tap sale came in December,
the government appointed JP Morgan
Chase in London and Citibank in the
same city as the receiving banks."

loods, impassable roads,

aftermath of three days of non-stop
rain in the coastal region.
Businesses have been hit hard,
including operations at the Mombasa port, where a traffic snarl-up
was witnessed.
Lorries heading to the port have
been stuck on the Mombasa-Nairobi highway near the Changamwe
roundabout.
The Kenya Ports Authority
(KPA) said operations came to
a standstill on Thursday as the
rains persisted, also affecting
standard gauge railway (SGR)
freight services.
“The rains have paralysed operations, prompting all ships at
the Conventional Cargo area to
close hatches. The most affected
vessels are those carrying wheat,
fertiliser, steal and coal. We are
doing deliveries only at the container terminal,” KPA said on its
Facebook page.
As a result, KPA said, there
would be slow cargo evacuation
and reduced SGR operations.
But the agency said it had put

mitigate against the issues.

The Kenya Forest Service (KFS)
has been warned against issuing
permits to people to cut down trees
without valid reasons as it leads to
environmental destruction.
West Pokot Governor John Lonyangapuo said he will recommend
the arrest of KFS officers sent from
Nairobi to issue permits for cutting
trees in the area. He said logging
has led to a decline in the county’s
forest cover, now at 4.4 per cent.
Speaking in Kapenguria when he
launched the distribution of free
150,000 tree seedlings under the
Environment ministry, Prof Lonyangapuo said: “They claim that our
officers don’t have guns. We shall
arrest you. I have put roadblocks at
Murkwijit and that’s where we meet
with [Interior Cabinet Secretary
Fred] Matiang’i,” he said.
The governor said the seedlings
will be distributed across 20 wards
to schools, churches, youth groups
and individuals.
Prof Lonyangapuo said the
county had used Sh5 million for
the programme to help increase
the forest cover, control soil erosion
and thus conserve water towers in
the region.
He urged residents to plant
trees to prevent landslides, which
are common in the area. “We urge
everyone in the county to plant
one tree a year. You need to fence
them to ensure animals don’t destroy them. We will give out prizes
to those who plant trees,” he said.

He dismissed fears that planting
trees will lead to the land being
taken from residents.

The 13-member team
appointed by Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya to
oversee the revival of the ailing
Mumias Sugar Company took
the oath of office on Friday,
amid opposition from the
firm’s management, which has
said the move is illegal.
The swearing-in ceremony was conducted at the
county government offices in
Kakamega by lawyer Moses

team.
Deputy Governor Philip

the task force.
The team has 14 days from
May 27 to report back to Mr

when he named the team.
The governor stormed the
company offices on Wednesday and named the task force,
led by Trade executive Kassim

The team has been mandated
to oversee the management of
the company’s nucleus estate
farms, safeguard assets and
draw a revival plan that will
be used to rejuvenate the
ailing firm.

wider Mumias region.
Prof Kutima sought to allay
fears that the county government was interested in taking
over the troubled miller, noting
that officials are interested in
reviving the company that is

The pain of losing his manhood at the tender age of 19
is what a Form Three student
from Samia sub-county cannot
fathom as he recuperates at
Busia County Referral Hospital.
This came as the police officer
accused of assaulting the student
denied the charges.
Police constable Collins Onyango appeared before Busia
Chief Magistrate William Chepseba yesterday.
The magistrate directed that
the accused be remanded until
May 29 when his application for
bail will be heard and to give the
prosecution time to gather more
evidence.
Narrating the ordeal from his
hospital bed on Thursday, the
youth said he was attacked on
Tuesday night by a policeman
who was in the company of three
other officers on patrol to flush
out chang’aa brewers.
He wondered why the officer
targeted his genitals in the
incident that took place a few
minutes to 8pm at a shopping
centre.
“I left home to buy soap to
wash my clothes when four
policemen on patrol passed by.
One of the officers followed me
to the shop and held me by the
neck,” he said.
“He started pulling me to

remove them. He is in stable condition and recovering well,” said
Dr Namudala Emukule, the deputy medical superintendent, who
added that the student would be
discharged in two or three days
once the pain subsides.
“Of course there are issues to
do with self-esteem that we have
to contain because he will feel
uncomfortable in the company
of his peers.”
But the doctor said the young
man’s bladder was still functional though he will not be able
to sire children.
The patient will have to undergo counselling to prepare
him for the next phase of life,
Dr Emukule said.
“He will not be discharged
like any other patient. He will
have to go through various
stages of counselling so that he
understands that the operation
is irreversible,” he said.
His mother has appealed to
the government to help her son
get justice. “It’s hard to explain
to him that he will not be able to
sire children,” said an emotional
mother.
She further urged Interior
Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i to moderate police patrols
within the confines of the law
and recommended time frames.

wards him but I held tightly onto
the shop’s grills. Realising I was
not cooperating, he pulled out
his baton and started hitting me,
injuring my genitals,” narrated
the distraught youth.
As the events unfolded, he
said, the shopkeeper serving
him hurriedly closed the shop
and advised him to run away. “I
was very weak after the beating
and could not walk. I slept on
the ground for about 20 minutes
before I left for home using a
shortcut. My attacker had left,”
he said.

Once he reached home, he
went to bed, prompting his
mother to ask him what had
happened.
The victim was later rushed
to Port Victoria Sub-County

evening and spent the night
there before being referred to the

hen Prof Muhammad Swazuri was sworn into office
〇〇〇

National Land Commission (NLC)
in February 2013, he promised Kenyans a new way of doing things on
land admin istration.
Prof Swazuri and his eight commissioners took oath of office a few
days after the second presidential
debate ahead of the March 4, 2013
General Election.
One of the hot topics in that
debate was the emotive land
issue that has been blamed for the
deadly clashes that continue to be
witnessed in various parts of the
country every few years.
All the candidates who participated in the debate placed great
faith in the NLC, a creature of the
2010 Constitution, to remedy the
situation by addressing historical land injustices and protecting
public land.
The right people had been picked
for the job, Kenyans believed. Prof
Swazuri, a holder of a PhD in Land
Economics, was leading a team of
highly qualified individuals in land
matters.
He did not disappoint in his first
public statement after being sworn
in by Chief Justice Willy Mutunga on
February 27, 2013, telling Kenyans
to worry about other important issues but not land since he was now
in charge.
“You heard from the debate… each
one of them saying that the NLC is
there; so now that we have arrived
we can tell them to remove it from
their agenda and if Kenyans have
other problems to do with land, they
should not refer them to the politicians because they have referred it
to the NLC,” Prof Swazuri said.
But six years down the line, the
cautionary words of CJ Mutunga,
who retired in 2016, to Prof Swazuri
and his team during that swearing-in
ceremony seem very prescient.
“You must have a stiff spine
and a cool head, guided by the
constitution,” Mr Mutunga said.
“The intricate web and reach of
interests around land is powerful
and smart. My plea to you is not
to allow the National Land Commission to be reduced to a theatre
of the absurd.”
No sooner had Dr Mutunga uttered those words than the opening
act of the NLC theatre of the absurd
began, through turf wars with then
Lands Cabinet Secretary Charity
Ngilu. The war crippled NLC operations for more than a year.
However, Kenyans, who feared
that the elite who were not happy
with the new commission were
behind the wars, threw their
weight behind Prof Swazuri and
his team.
Soon the turf wars were resolved
by the Supreme Court in favour of
the NLC. But since then the faith
that Kenyans had in the commission to deliver on its mandate has
largely dissipated.

a good opportunity to serve this
country and improve land administration,” said Mr Ibrahim Mwathane,

“At its assumption of office, most
stakeholders had immense trust in it
and, therefore, provided unwavering
support. But now there is anxiety
that the entry of the commission has
ended up introducing more confusion into land administration in the
country,” he said.
Mr Odenda Lumumba, the
executive director of the Kenya
Land Alliance while critical about
the “disappointing” performance of
NLC so far, reserved the harshest
criticism for the NLC chairman.
“He is an indecisive character,”
he said. “The commission generally lacked firm leadership. The
commissioners are known to feud
in public. Swazuri was a compromise candidate for the post and
overtime he became pliant to the
many vested interests in the land
sector.”
The commission has reeled from
one scandal to another and Prof
Swazuri has been at the centre of
them. Only last month the chairman was on the spotlight over a
controversial compensation worth
billions of shillings to a businessman
for land in Ruaraka, Nairobi.
Our inquiries established that
there are a total of 276 complaints
filed against the NLC at the Ethics
and Anti-Corruption Commission
(EACC) with 71 specifically about
compensation.
In the most recent case, the
(EACC) is investigating how the
NLC unilaterally gave ownership
of land illegally hived off the Moi
International Airport in Mombasa
to a group of businessman when
a corruption case touching on its
acquisition is ongoing.
The resolution by NLC without
the Kenya Airports Authority (KAA)
being heard, has also resulted in dismissal of charges against some of
the suspects seven years after the
case was filed at the anti-corruption
magistrate’s court in Nairobi.
The decision by NLC was contained in a Gazette notice dated
July 17, 2017. The action by NLC
means that the land is now rightfully owned by a private firm, the
Gas Company Ltd.
The land is alleged to have been
irregularly excised from the original
land of the Kenya Airports Authority
and transferred to the company on
October 2, 1996.
After investigations by the
defunct Kenya Anti-Corruption
Commission, nine suspects were
charged in court in 2010 over the
illegal transfer and acquisition of
the land.
The suspects were businessman
Joshua Kulei, businessman Prakash
Bundia, former KAA managing director Peter Lagat, former Lands
Commissioner Wilson Gachanja,
former Kenya Pipeline Company
managing director Ezekiel Komen,
The Gas Company Ltd, (owned by
Bhundia) Ashar Company Ltd, Sian
Enterprises Ltd, and Agrid Ltd.
The NLC purported to settle the
matter through a public hearing
when the criminal case against the
nine was still pending in court.

tourism numbers.
Afterwards, Kenya’s Trade Principal
Secretary Chris Kiptoo, who represented
Cabinet Secretary Peter Munya, signed a
deal with US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to establish a US-Kenya
Trade Investment Group.
A joint communique signed by the two
officials said the group will be some form
of a committee meant to “explore ways
to deepen the trade and investment ties
between the two countries"".
Part of its terms of reference is to “support comprehensive trade policies and
begin to lay groundwork for a stronger
future trade relationship”, a reference to
gradual reduction of barriers to trade
under bilateral agreements like Agoa.
Dr Kiptoo told the _Nation_ the group
will also be charged with ensuring both
sides benefit fully from the remaining
years of Agoa, set to expire in 2025.
Kenya already enjoys significant trade
volumes, standing an average of Sh100
billion with more than Sh40 billion
worth of exports to the US under Agoa
in 2017. Kenya says Agoa has created
60,000 jobs, but critics say it benefits
foreigners because firms exporting apparel to the US under Agoa are mostly
foreign ventures.
In Washington, the President was
promoting the country as open for more
investments. “Kenya is open for business
and all we want to do is package our
partnership in a way that it is mutually



beneficial to you as a private sector and
the people of Kenya,” President Kenyatta
told a gathering of US investors under
the Business Council for International
Understanding, a non-profit US organisation that organises trade forums.
He told the group, where US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Rose was
present, about the benefits of setting
up shop in Kenya for opportunities
created by the Big Four development
blueprint projects. The Big Four is
the President’s legacy programme to
improve manufacturing, food security,
healthcare and housing. The Big Four
is, however, threatened by corruption.
This agenda also needs funds because
Kenya wants to raise manufacturing from
8.4 per cent to 15 per cent of the GDP
by 2022, build at least 500,000 housing

construction and operation of a 100-megawatt wind power plant near Ngong Hills.
The funding from the US Overseas
Private Investment Corporation (Opic)
is part of the US government’s Power
Africa Initiative to generate more green
energy for African homes using pooled
funding from the private sector.
“By addressing some of the country’s
most pressing development needs from
power to transportation infrastructure,
these projects will be hugely impactful
engines of economic growth and regional
stability throughout Kenya,” said Ray
Washburne, President and Chief Executive Officer of Opic.
As one of the largest US direct investments in Kenya, Kipeto is a special
purpose vehicle for the wind power
project in Kajiado County.
In 2016, China Machinery Engineering
Corporation clinched the Sh22.6 billion
contract for the engineering design, procurement and construction of the wind
farm. But last year, it ran into trouble
with conservationists who argued the
power plant was a risk to nesting sites
for endangered birds.
But Kenya had to give more. In a
press presentation, President Trump
confirmed the construction of the controversial Nairobi-Mombasa highway
will go on, despite the protestations on
debt. “Your representatives have been
dealing with our representatives and
making a lot of progress. We’re talking
about a very major highway. And that
seems to be going along well. That’s a
very important project, I think, for your
country,” he said.
The 473-kilometre highway, whose
cost could be as high as $3.5 billion is to
be constructed by US firm Bechtel, just
a year after the standard gauge railway
on the same route was completed at a
cost of Sh327 billion, yet to be repaid.
A final financing deal may mean more
debt for Kenya.

usty gates. Deserted homes.
Hollowness. The elite res## R idential neighbourhood of

Langau in Ongata Rongai that
beamed with life just five years ago
is a pale shadow of its former self.
Palatial homes that dotted the
area now lie in sordid rubble and
gloom.
The fortunes of the area have
dramatically changed, thanks to
the standard gauge railway.
If Mr Joseph Alukwe had his way,
the SGR would never have passed
through his land.
Mr Alukwe, 50, from Olooltepes,
says his life was destabilised four
years ago by one of the Jubilee
government’s signature projects.
When the area was marked for
the line in 2014, Kenya Railways
informed the blind man that the
government would only compensate him for the structures on his
piece of land.
Any future projects would not be
considered for the payout.
Since then, his one-acre piece of
land has been lying idle, save for
his three-bedroom house.
China Road and Bridge Corporation workers pulled down several
structures on his plot while erecting
pillars for a bridge meant for the
railway line.
Not even his wife’s grave will be
spared when the line is finally laid.
To Mr Alukwe and his family,
the railway project has brought
untold misery.
Mr Alukwe’s grievances mirror
the misery of hundreds of other
families in Ongata Rongai and
Ngong, whose land was taken by the
government for the grand project.
From poor compensation terms,
delayed payouts and unreliable
information from the government,
landowners now believe Kenya
Railways is deliberately shortchanging them.
A month after the National Land
Commission said the government
had released more than Sh10 billion

would only pay for the demolished
section. No explanation was given
for the decision.
Tenants moved out when multiple structural assessments showed
that the remaining rooms were not
habitable.
The dispute has prompted some
landowners to block the implementation of the project until Kenya
Railways listens to their grievances
and acts accordingly.
China Road and Bridge Corporation has, in the meantime,
skipped the disputed sections and
proceeded with other areas in a
race to meet the 54-month deadline.
“If the government had paid
me, I would be long gone. I would
have bought land elsewhere and
constructed a house. The longer the
government takes to compensate
us, the higher the value of the land
gets,” Mr Alukwe added.
In some areas, the contractor had
to give money to families to move.
〇〇〇


However, the families are back
on their lands due to the delayed
compensation by the government.
And they insist on remaining.
Because of the protracted dis###### fi f


pute, CRBC has laid off many casual
employees.
Machines have also been
grounded.
Already, the Chinese company
has signalled that the project may
not be completed within the set
timelines.
Initially, the government gave
the families three months to leave
after being compensated.
The period was later reduced
to 45 days, and further down to
a month.
“It is unrealistic for the government to ask us to leave when
we have not been compensated.
Where are we expected to go? Does
this government really care?” Mr
Alukwe asked.
While admitting that some property owners have refused to leave,
Ongata Rongai and Ngong residents
fault the State for using the same
""brutal"" tactics on those who have
co-operated with the authorities.
“The government should deal
with those blocking the project
and be fair to the rest of us. Why
should everybody suffer because of
the mistakes of a few?” asked Mr
Anthony Ngugi, a resident.
He added that many residents
have inflated the value of their land.
Residents of Kajiado County say
it is not their business if the money
meant for compensation has been
stolen by government functionaries.
“The government should sort out
the mess and compensate us since
that is what the law says,” said an
Ongata Rongai local who did not
wish to be named.


〇〇〇

more than Sh4 million, but the
government insists on paying Sh2
million, residents say.
“Where will I get land and build
a house with that amount? I have
developed this place for 10 years.
If I don't get the value for my property, it will take me years back,” Mr
Alukwe said.
Residents say they wrote a ""genuine"" complaint to the government
two months ago but have not receive feedback from State officials
or Kenya Railways.
Curiously, the landowners were
not involved in the valuation.
Even owners of residential and
commercial buildings say they feel
cheated.
A property owner saw half his
two-storey apartment complex
demolished to pave the way for
the project.
Despite his demands for full compensation, Kenya Railways said it


〇〇〇

on time,” the commission said in
a statement.
Landowners — particularly in
the Ngong station, Mai Mahiu and
Suswa sections of the SGR — have
not submitted their title deeds and
other necessary documents, arguing that the rates offered by the
government are too low and unfair.
“The government promised fair
compensation when the valuation of
land was done last year. We would
be compensated according to the
market value of the land,” a dejected
Mr Alukwe told the _Nation_ .
""In circumstances that are not
clear, the award was halved. We
were told it was a directive from
the President.""
The development means families
cannot buy land in neighbouring

areas.

**BY JAMES KAHONGEH**


The woes of Pamela Achieng, a
resident of Langau in Ongata Rongai,
have nothing to do with the land compensation saga that has bedevilled the
construction of Phase Two A of the
standard gauge railway line.
Her land is 300 metres from the
course of the railway track and outside
the compensation demarcation.
However, her dispute with the government started last year when the
National Environment Management Authority (Nema) allowed the contractor,
China Road and Bridge Corporation,
to blast a quarry only 200 metres from
her home for rocks, pausing danger to
the structural stability of her three-bedroom house.
Even after demanding a written assurance from the contractor that her
property would not be affected, the firm


〇〇〇

produced no documentation.
“The Chinese assured me that the
damage would only be minimal and
that there was no need to worry,” she
told the _Nation_ .
A few days later, the contractor
would ask her to vacate the premises,
saying that it was not safe for her and
her family.
“I hesitated, since I had nowhere
else to take my children,” Achieng said.
“After negotiating with the Chinese,
we reached a gentleman’s consensus.
I was to leave my house for a day to
allow them to blast the quarry in case
there was danger to our lives.”
Thus agreed, Achieng left with her
children for a day. She later returned
and went about her life.
But in circumstances that were never
explained, the builders blasted the
quarry one afternoon when Achieng
and her children were at home.


〇〇〇


〇〇〇

Her house developed multiple severe
cracks owing to the powerful blast. The
crevices have been widening by the day.
Entire sections of houses belonging to
her neighbours bear dangerous fissures
from the blasts.
Some of these neighbours have been
unable to move out due to delayed
government payouts.


〇〇〇

Yet this is not what Achieng is hung
up about.
“I am disappointed in the manner in
which the contractor and Kenya Railways have so far handled this matter.
Nema and Kenya Railways have not
given me audience to air my grievances.
I have written to them through my
lawyer, but no action has been taken,”
she lamented.
Achieng added: “The Chinese have
been threatening me every time I try to
engage them. They have told me that
this is a government project that must
go on no matter what. I feel violated
and helpless.”
A spokesperson for the firm, however,
denied claims that Achieng has been
harassed by its officers.
The single mother of two now lives
in dread of a possible collapse of her
house should the contractor blast the
quarry again.

When President Kenyatta
launched the inaugural Standard

to Suswa in October, he noted
that the train service would ease
the movement of people and
goods along the 100-kilometre
stretch.
The railway line was also
touted as a magic bullet that
would open up the area for development. Two months later,
there is little to show for the
second phase of the multibillionshilling Jubilee government’s
pet project, and whose viability
remains questionable.

might inspire investments into this
vast, uncharted territory, the slow
take-off was perhaps unforeseen.
As time drags, more people
trickle in. Five minutes to departure
is boarding time. In Car Two, there
are only 30 of us, out of a capacity
of 118. The seats are spacious and
fairly comfortable. It turns out that
this car is the most occupied, with
the others nearly empty.
At exactly 6.50pm, the train
begins the trip across the national
park to Rongai, a 23-minute journey.
It is pitch dark when we arrive
at the Rongai station, an immaculate, modern facility. It could be
anywhere in a Western capital.
The passengers disembark and
disappear into darkness.
So, how do they get home?
“I always have a boda-boda rider
waiting for me,” says John Gathii, a
resident of Maasai Lodge. He pays
Sh200 for the ride home.
“It’s more convenient than the
hustle of traffic,’’ says Gathii, whose
relative proximity to the station is
an advantage.
Luckily for him, he has a business
in Syokimau. When he factors in
the cost of fuelling his car, riding
the train makes economic sense.


**Cheaper and faster**
Not so for Diana, who lives
in Kware. For her, getting home
presents a fresh challenge. “I fear
being mugged but I also don’t want
to sit in traffic for hours,” laments
the young mother. So she usually
takes a boda-boda with whoever
is willing to share the Sh200 fare.
‘‘Sometimes I’m not lucky so
I foot the bill alone. The train is
cheaper and faster, but it’s not
convenient at all,” she remarks.
When passengers disembark in
Rongai, the car is nearly empty.
Not even the handful of twilight
travellers who board during the
four-minute stop here are enough
to fill the carriage.
The train then heads to Ngong
station. Except for the attendants,
the station here is virtually deserted. There are no taxis around.
About 10 of the passengers disperse
in all directions turning down offers
to ride on boda-bodas.
Ngong Town is five kilometres
from the station, and one has to
take a bus at Veterinary, the nearest
shopping centre. A dirt, potholed
road connects the station to the
shopping centre. Called Kangawa,
this road is virtually impassable
when it rains.



some of these projects have faced
a backlash and have had to be
downsized or suspended due to
unserviceable debts or corruption.
This particular phase of the
standard gauge railway was to end

A security guard at one of checks

When I arrive, he dreamily shows
me in and retrieves his baton from

sprawled on one of the benches
in the lobby and a couple totally
immersed in their smartphones,
the 1,000-capacity waiting area is
virtually empty.
Kenya took a Sh150 billion loan
from China to build this particular
section. Whether it will get passengers and cargo soon to repay that
loan, only time will tell.
China has been dishing out billions of dollars to any country that
cares to ask for building highways,
ports, and as part of its Belt and

_Murder on the Orient Express_, what

It is rush hour in Nairobi, and
buses to the city suburbs are full.
But at the Syokimau train station,
things are very different.
While it is manned, the counter
serving Rongai and Ngong destinations has sluggish traffic. At times it
can be dormant the whole day, save
for a few minutes of mild activity
at “peak” hours in the mornings

At 5.20pm, we found the canteen
and coffee shop at Syokimau station
had already closed for the day. With
nothing to do, station workers idle
about, waiting for time to go home.
At 6pm, 50 minutes to departure time, the train from Rongai
announces its arrival with a loud
screech. It’s in this 10-carriage

through, offering a panoramic view

by the government to transfer all
imported cargo from Mombasa
to Nairobi through the Standard
Gauge Railway.
On Friday night, the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) and Kenya
Ports Authority (KPA) said all
imported cargo will be transported
from the port to Nairobi through
the railway starting on August 7.
""All imported cargo for delivery
to Nairobi and hinterland shall
be conveyed by SGR and cleared
at the Inland Container Depot in
Nairobi while all cargo intended for
Mombasa and its environs shall be
cleared at the Port of Mombasa,""
read part of the notice to the public.
The move will render hundreds
of employees working in different
Container Freight Stations (CFS)
and clearing and forwarding agents
in Mombasa jobless as more than 85
per cent of cargo would be cleared
in Nairobi.
Different stakeholders in the
industry have protested against
the government's move, saying
the mandatory rule violates the
World Trade Organisation (WTO)
agreement which call for free flow
of cargo by the most cost-effective
means. Kenya is a signatory to
the rules.
Kenya International Freight and
Warehousing Association (Kifwa)



chairman Roy Mwanthi said the
association is set to issue official
complaint to the government to
demonstrate their frustrations.
""The move has killed all CFSs
and is the last nail to the economy
of Mombasa as we expect hundreds
of job losses,"" said Mr Mwanthi.
More than 20 CFSs that have
invested Sh12.5 billion in the region
and over 800 trucks that operate
daily in Mombasa may not get
business if the new directive is
implemented, rendering thousands
jobless. This is in addition to the
lodges and restaurants that depend
on the trucks not only at the C oast,
but in other parts of the country
where truck drivers and conductors
eat and sleep.
Truck owners who have been the
most hit since the introduction of



freight train service over a year
ago have decried loss of business,
with some planning to resell their
trucks.
""My members will lose big in
the SGR project. Drivers, loaders
and turn boys have lost jobs as
most containers are collected in
Embakasi, Nairobi. Majority of
transporters will now be forced to
move out of Mombasa as business
here is no longer viable,"" said
Kenya Transport Association chief
operations officer Mercy Ireri.
Ms Ireri said SGR has brought
a curse to the secto r with conventional cargo owners in East
Africa complaining of the delay of
their cargo deliveries compared
to when they were being ferried
using trucks.
""The process of clearance at ICD
in Nairobi has become tiresome
and complex since they are yet to
streamline the services hence it
takes more days for clients to get
their cargo in Uganda as compared
to when it is transported using

trucks from Mombasa. It takes at
least two-and-a-half days to deliver
cargo to Uganda using trucks but
due to complex process at ICD, it
can take more than five days for
goods to reach the country,"" said
Ms Ireri.
SGR, a flagship project of the
Kenya V ision 2030, has been billed
as the biggest transport infrastructure project in the country's history
and is expected to haul close to
nine million tonnes of cargo using
railway to make a profit of Sh5.08
billion in a year, averaging Sh424
million earnings per month.
This is compared to 990,488
tonnes carried in the first year
where SGR made a loss of close
to Sh10 billion.
According to statistics, since the
introduction of 100 per cent exhook railage in May this year, KPA
dispatches at least 10 SGR cargo
trains carrying more than 1,000
containers to Nairobi every day.
In January, they recorded 214
trains, February 172, March 184



while in April and May 203 trains
which transported cargo to Nairobi
while June recorded the highest
performance of an average of 13
trains per day.
Most of the cargo transported
from Mombasa according to records were hides, french beans,
coffee and empty containers
which has boosted the volumes
transported.

Lebanese construction firm Zakhem’s controversy-ridden association
with Kenya Pipeline Company (KPC)
has been capped with the tax agency
narrowing on it over Sh17.9 billion in
unpaid taxes.
The High Court on Wednesday
ruled in favour of the Kenya Revenue
Authority (KRA) to stop KPC from
paying the Lebanese firm Sh7.8 billion
that was pending from the Sh48.8
billion contract for the construction of
the 450-kilometre Mombasa-Nairobi
pipeline.
Justice Margaret Muigai of Commercial & Tax Division ruled that
KRA could be exposed if KPC was
allowed to pay the balance of the contract sum before an appeal by Zakhem
against the Sh17.9 billion the taxman
is demanding from them is heard and
determined.
“Of importance since the dispute
entails tax remittance and there is
possibility of funds transfer pending
the hearing and determination of the
appeal the balance of convenience
tilts to withholding the secured sum
until hearing and determination of the



appeal,” the judge stated in her ruling.
The appeal against the sum of Sh17.9
billion is still pending before the Tax
Appeals Tribunal. In a statement, KRA
sounded upbeat about the ruling.
“Section 42 of the Tax Procedures
Act allows the KRA, where reasonable
grounds exist pointing to the possibility that the taxpayer will not pay
the tax by the due date, by notice in
writing require a person who owes
money to the taxpayer, to pay the
amount specified in the notice to the
KRA,” KRA Commissioner for Legal
Services & Board Coordination Paul
Matuku said in the statement.


**Priority**
According to Mr Matuku, the appeal
pending before the Tribunal must now
be heard on a priority basis as ordered
by the court.
“The Kenya Revenue Authority
(KRA) is demanding Sh17.9 billion
in taxes from Zakhem International
Construction Limited (ZIC), a company incorporated under the laws of
the Republic of Cyprus with offices
in Beirut, Lebanon,” said Mr Matuku.
The unpaid taxes consist of corporation tax, Pay as You Earn, withholding,



income tax and value added tax (VAT)
covering 2014 to 2016. Zakhem had in
July 2014 won Sh48.5 billion contract





at KPC to lay a new pipeline from
Mombasa to Nairobi to replace the
company’s ageing line.
But the contract has been a subject
of several controversies which started
as soon as the award was made with
some rival bidders unsuccessfully
appealing the award before the Public
Procurement Regulatory Authority’s
(PPRA’s) review board.
In implementation of the contract,
the Lebanese firm had promised to
complete the work in 18 months.
However, four years down the line,
only 220 kilometres of the pipeline
has been completed.
Also controversial has been the additional Sh4.4 billion that Zakhem was
demanding from KPC for operational
delays reportedly occasioned by lapses
on the part of the project consultant
Shengli Engineering and Consulting
Company Ltd, changes to design and
delays by the National Treasury in
releasing funds to finance the project.
The award of the tender to Zakhem
and the execution of the project is
currently the subject of investigations
amid allegations of the cost having
been inflated by up to at least Sh2.7
billion."

enya is expected to spend
up to Sh640.8 billion in
〇〇〇

service its Sh5.3 trillion debt, the
2020 _Economic Survey_ report
shows.
The country’s total stock of public debt went up by 16.8 per cent
as at the end of June 2019, from
Sh4.5 trillion the previous year.
That also saw the external debt,
which accounted for 57 per cent
of the total debt, grow by 17.7 per
cent to stand at Sh3.02 trillion.
The external debt stood at
Sh2.56 trillion in 2018.
The National Treasury saw its
appetite for domestic debt rise by
15.7 per cent to Sh2.29 trillion.
Already, the Treasury wants to
change the country’s external debt
composition by reducing concessional borrowing to 15 per cent in
the 2020/21 financial year, from
the current 34 per cent.
Treasury Cabinet Secretary
Ukur Yatani proposes to increase
commercial financing from four
to 13 per cent in the financial year
that begins in June.
This will see commercial borrowing increase to Sh274.4 billion
from Sh313.1 billion.
China remains Kenya’s top
creditor, with the debt growing
by more than Sh100 billion, from
Sh560.5 billion in June last year
to Sh661.05 billion at the start of
the current financial year.
This was part of the money used
to finance the standard gauge
railway.
Kenya also saw its debt from
Japan increase by 38.4 per cent
to stand at Sh135.2 billion, from
Sh97.7 billion.
The United States reduced its
debt to Kenya to Sh2 billion from
Sh2.6 billion in 2018.
Washington’s debt to Kenya
stood at Sh4.4 billion in 2015.
The money owed to the International Development Association/



i


International Fund for Agricultural
Development (IDA/IFAD) rose by
12.7 per cent to Sh591.3 billion at
the end of June 2019.
The country also saw the
borrowing from the African Development Bank (AfDB) grow by
12.2 per cent to Sh229.6 billion,
while the amount owed to the
International Monetary Fund
(IMF) dropped from Sh71.5 billion
to Sh49.2 billion, the report said.
Kenya increased its borrowing
from international commercial
banks through syndicated loans
to Sh471.7 billion at the start of
the current financial year from
Sh426.4 billion.
The National Treasury saw a
rise in the international sovereign
bonds to Sh624.01 billion from
Sh479.98 billion a year earlier.
Kenya has issued three Eurobonds, distributed in values of
Sh275 billion, Sh200 billion and
Sh210 billion.
The Sh200 billion Eurobond
was issued on February 28, 2018
in two Sh100 billion tranches of
10-year at a coupon of 7.25 per
cent and 30-year at a coupon of



i



i


8.25 per cent.
The interest is payable on February 28 and August 28 of every year.
Taxpayers fork out Sh15.63
billion in interest payments just
for this Eurobond annually.
Kenya’s outstanding debt to
commercial banks rose by 10.6
per cent to stand at Sh471.7 billion while the internal debt from
Treasury bonds and Treasury bills
accounted for 33 per cent and 18
per cent of the overall debt position, respectively.
The KNBS data shows that
Treasury bonds rose by 15.6 per
cent to Sh1.74 trillion, while the
Treasury bills also recorded a rise
of 26.7 per cent to Sh954.3 billion.
Kenya’s net servicing charges on
internal and external debt grew by
26.6 per cent to Sh842.4 billion
last year, while its receipts on interest and loan repayments rose
by 37.6 per cent to Sh3.9 billion.
The net charges on external debt
servicing grew by 50.7 per cent

Police are investigating the
circumstances under which a
36-year-old man was burnt to death
in his car in Buru Buru, Nairobi,
yesterday morning.
Police removed the charred remains of Mr Terrance Korir from
his car after neighbours and city
firefighters extinguished the blaze.
Mr Korir’s car was parked in his
compound.
Few neighbours were aware of the
8.30am incident until fire engines
started arriving.
He died in the driver’s seat. Witnesses said there was no indication
that Mr Korir attempted to leave
the vehicle.
Kamukunji Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) boss Adan
Guyo said detectives took samples
from the car to determine what
exactly caused the fire.
Mr Guyo led senior officers, in


i



i


Buru Police Station and the body
moved to the Chiromo mortuary.
The interior of the car was extensively damaged but the exterior,
including the tyres, was intact.
The engine was also intact, with
plumes of smoke emanating from
inside the car.
“Preliminary investigations have
established that this person lives
in Buru Buru Phase Five with his
wife and two children aged three
and one,” Mr Guyo told journalists
at the scene.
“The vehicle was near his house.
We want to establish what exactly
happened.”


**Blaze being investigated**
He refused to provide more information, saying investigations
had just begun.
“We are not at a position to state
the exact cause of the fire. We
cannot tell if it was an accident or
intentional,” he said.
Mr Guyo said Mr Korir’s wife
could not be interviewed, because
she was not in a position to talk.
Police were called to the scene by
Mahi Mahiu court chairman Cyrus
Chenge after he was told by guards
that a car was on fire.
Mr Korir’s neighbours said they
did not know about the blaze until
they heard sirens from the city fire
brigade engines.
Neighbours of Mr Korir’s that the
_Nation_ spoke to said they did not
know what happened.
None of them wanted to disclose
their identities.
Kamukunji police Commander
Adamson Bungei said investigations
into the incident were underway.

13.5 per cent to Sh488.8 billion,
the report added.
Last year also saw Kenya’s ratio
of external debt servicing charges
to foreign exchange earnings from
exports of goods and services
drop.


**Threshold bridged**
These earnings are an indicator
of the ability of the economy to
service external debt.
The debt-servicing charges rose
to 30.2 per cent compared to 20
recorded in 2018.
This means that the Treasury
has breached the 21 per cent
threshold set by the IMF.
The country’s public and publicly guaranteed debt has grown by
an annualised rate of 19 per cent
over the last 10 years.
This is due to an increase in
expenditure, led by infrastructural
investments and cost of government free services, shortfalls in
revenue forecast and shrinking
fiscal space as a result of increase
in compulsory expenditure like
debt servicing.

The number of children enrolling in
primary schools dropped by 400,000
last year, an indication of poor transition
from Early Childhood Development
Education centres.
This is contained in the 2020 Kenya
National Bureau of Statics (KNBS)
_Economic Survey_ released by Treasury
Cabinet Secretary Ukur Yatani.
The total enrolment in primary
schools went down to 10.1 million from
10.5 million in 2018.
“On a positive note, enrolment in
secondary schools increased by 10.8 per
cent to 3.3 million in 2019. In 2018, the
figure was 2.9 million,” Mr Yatani said.
He added that it indicates the 100
per cent transition policy is working.
Last year also saw enrolment in
technical and vocational education and



i


training (TVET) institutes increase by
18.3 per cent to 430,598 from 363,884
in 2018.
At the same time, enrolment in national polytechnics rose by 28.6 per
cent to 102,078.
It was one of the highest enrolments
witnessed in years.
Admission into public technical and
vocational colleges increased by 32.8
per cent to 112,110.
“However, university enrolment is
expected to decline to 509,473 from
519,462 in the 2018/19 financial year,”
Mr Yatani said, without offering an
explanation.
Infrastructure in primary and secondary schools declined by 14.7 per cent
and 8.2 per cent respectively.
At the same time, pre-primary schools
increased by 10 per cent to 46,530 in
the same period as counties ramped up



i


their spending on these centres.
The number of TVET institutions
increased by 10.3 per cent to 2,191, the
report adds.
The Higher Education Loans Board
saw beneficiaries rise by 6.3 per cent to
293,249, from 275,823 in 2018, with the
amounts awarded being Sh11.7 billion
from Sh11 billion 2018.
The report says by the end of this
financial year, the overall expenditure
on health by the government will rise
by 50.9 per cent to Sh115.8 billion while

The National Hospital Insurance
Fund saw its membership grow by 10.6
per cent to 8.5 million, while payouts
increased by 36.8 per cent to Sh53.4

“The number of hospitals increased
by 5.2 per cent to 13,790 in 2019, with
Level Two facilities accounting for
77.4 per cent.
“Levels Four, Five and Six hospitals
accounted for 5.8 per cent of the increase,” Mr Yatani said.
The report adds that the leading

Confirmed malaria cases increased
by 18.6 per cent to 4.7 million in 2019,

rom providing suppliers with
operating capital to using
〇〇〇

and Kenya Ports Authority (KPA)
employees have taken advantage
of the agency’s weak procurement
system to make millions of shillings
in questionable deals.
Even as KPA’s revenue rose to
Sh26.42 billion in 2019, it almost
matched its expenditure of Sh21.42
billion, with many of the payments
raising eyebrows.
These are some of the concerns
raised by the KPA Board Audit
and Risk Committee report last
week, pointing to a parastatal held
hostage by crooked workers taking
advantage of a weak system that
can be easily manipulated.
Supplying water to the parastatal
has become the easiest cash-minting venture for the crooks.
The report, seen by the _Nation_,
shows that KPA paid Sh200 million
for water without any delivery note
from the supplier.
In some cases, the contract delivery price was inflated by up to
25 per cent.
“Instances where delivery notes
for the supply of water were missing were noted. Payments were
processed, based on the quantities
stipulated in the contract — fixed
at 1,000 cubic metres daily — regardless of the quantities delivered,”
the audit report says.
“For instance, payments for the
supply of potable water — Tender
No KPA/054/2014-15/ID by Logitech Ltd — is processed based on
production reports and not delivery
notes. In the period under review,
two LPOs amounting to Sh205.2
million were paid without receipt



of delivery notes.”
The contract for supply of water
— Tender No KPA/054/2014-15/
ID — was also varied in price and
scope of activities by more than
25 per cent of the original price in
contravention of the 2015 Public
Procurement and Disposal Act.
“There was overall variation
of 289 per cent on the original
contract price, which resulted
in change from Sh180 to Sh450
per cubic metre and introduction
of distribution and maintenance
works at Sh250 per cubic metre,”
the report adds.
In another instance, KPA entertained an inflated water supply
charge without raising a finger,
allowing the supplier to demand
twice the market rates and outside
the contractual terms.
Under the contract for tender No
KPA/054/2014-15/CE — Supply of
Potable Water at Mombasa port —
the price charge per tonne was not
to exceed Mombasa Water Service
Company (Mowasco) rates.



**Direct procurement**
However, the auditors pointed
out that the price for the supply of
water was 125 per cent above what
Mowasco charged.
“Mowasco water tariff structure
as at November 25, 2019 was between Sh75 and Sh200 per cubic
metre, whereas that of Logitech is
Sh450 as per the deed of contract
variation,” the report says.
“This price was arrived at following negotiations on July 3, 2018.
Nevertheless, the prevailing market
rates were not considered.”
The board is considering setting
up a desalination plant to ensure the
parastatal has its own fresh water.
It has sought a report on the cost
of setting up the plant.
It also emerged that the water



“This resulted in circumventing
the rigorous procedures for procuring capital expenditure as well
as understating assets balances in
books,” the audit report says.
The parastatal failed to reconcile
its standard gauge railway (SGR)
accounts for the last year totalling
Sh2.06 billion, thus exposing it to
losses given that Kenya Railways
has not been able to process these
claims.
The KPA head of SGR reconciliation has never offered any
explanation for this. KPA is on the
spotlight for extending generous
payment holidays to its clients,
who were required to pay cash for
services, inversely providing these
companies with operating capital.
“The head of the internal audit
and risk management reported
cases of customers with outstanding debts whose credit limits were
not being adhered to,” the audit
report goes on.
“The board committee was informed that Finance has reviewed
credit limits and some customers
have enhanced their guarantees
in line with the current business
model. However, there were instances where customers violated
their guarantees.”



“The head of the internal audit
and risk management unit informed
the committee that there was a
challenge in establishing water
consumption at the authority since
metering has not been done.”
The procurement department
and the agency’s top management
are on the spot after the internal
audit found that several contracts
for providing services were extended after the lapse of their
expiry period.
“This led to the award of construction work or supply of goods
to the same companies for an
extended period without fresh
competitive bidding,” the damning
report says.
There were cases of direct procurement, where civil works for
painting were procured directly
and quoted under Tender No
KPA/084/2016-16/CE for specialised painting.
However, neither the tender nor
any related contract documents
could be traced. There was also
non-adherence to the asset capitalisation policy, with works that
were capital in nature expensed.
This goes against the parastatal’s
policy on managing non-current
assets under capitalisation.

the management of the agency is

other major users, dust suppression

of general public importance because
“the judgement I intend to challenge
raises cardinal issues of jurisprudence”.
Mr Waruhiu said among the issues to
be raised is the legal basis that can be
used to defeat the statute of limitations
in the absence of fraud and what other
grounds can be invoked to defeat the
indefeasible right to title.
But the court said Mr Waruhiu was
canvassing his application in the wrong
forum.
“Jurisdiction is a creation of statute
and this court cannot assume jurisdiction. The correct forum to seek the
extension of time to lodge a notice of
appeal challenging the decision of this
court is the Supreme Court,” Justice
Sichale said.
She added that the rules provide for
enlargement of time.
According to the judge, the enlargement of time can only be at the Supreme
Court and not the Court of Appeal.
Senior Chief Waruhiu had five wives



and he died without distributing his
estate.
His 55-acre farm was divided into
five parcels.
Every parcel was registered in the
name of the firstborn son of each
household.
There was a dispute on whether
David Wainaina Waruhiu (deceased)
was the registered owner of the land at
the centre of the row and as a trustee
for his mother’s household.
On October 17, 1980, he transferred
the land to Mr Waruhiu following which,
Samuel Njoroge (deceased), Ms Nyamweru and Mr Ng’ang’a filed a case at the
High Court seeking orders to be made
the sole beneficiaries.
The three argued that their brother
David had no power to transfer the
property to Mr Waruhiu without their
consent. They also wanted an order
issued restraining Mr Waruhiu from
selling the property or receiving proceeds from such sale.

An inheritance row between the children of a colonial chief has taken a twist
after a judge rejected an application
by one of them to take the fight to the
Supreme Court.
Appellate court Judge Fatuma Sichale
said the court lacks the authority to
grant Mr George Kang’ethe Waruhiu
the order to extend the time to challenge a decision made by three judges
of the same court on the ownership of
a 55-acre tract in Githunguri, Kiambu
County.
Mr Waruhiu wanted the court to
suspend the execution of the ruling
made by justices Phillip Waki, Roselyene Nambuye and Gatembu Kairu on
March 8, 2019, pending the hearing and
determination of his intended appeal at
the Supreme Court.
The court had ruled in favour of Mr
Waruhiu’s relatives — Esther Nyamweru
and Solomon Nga’ng’a — declaring







them the rightful owners of property
through customary trust.
Aggrieved, Mr Waruhiu instructed
his advocates to file an appeal.
They filed a notice of motion seeking
the authority to appeal to the Supreme
Court as a matter of general public
importance but inadvertently omitted
to file a notice of appeal.
Mr Waruhiu said he would have filed
the notice of appeal on time had his
advocates not made the mistake.
He added that he had been sick since
the ruling was delievred and could not
therefore attend to the matter.
Mr Waruhiu faulted the judgment for
failing to consider compensation to the
bona fide buyer.
He added that the property was acquired forcibly after the ruling.
He said the respondents then demanded the release of Sh23 million
awarded in a different case.
In the notice of motion, Mr Waruhiu

the sudden changes have raised
concerns on the treatment of the

to have taken an unexpected turn on

“This basically involved appearing before the board and making

“The Authority (KPA) has continued to provide resources in form of
equipment and labour to facilitate
the operations of the SGR project.
This is due to the fact that the Rail
Mounted Gantry Cranes (RMGs) at
the Port Reitz Marshalling yard are
yet to be operationalised. The purpose of this letter is to request you
to remit Sh13,618,517,755.21, being

Daniel Manduku wrote on July 4.
Kenya Railways did not immediately respond to our queries over the
costly demand, despite promising
to do so “in due course”.
Documents seen by the _Sunday_
_Nation_ however detail that KRC had
sought the intervention of the Chinese contractor on a plan of action
to replace the moribund cranes that
were still bleeding the corporation
more money as they continued to
stay idle at the port.
The CRBC declined to comment
on whether it was going to foot the
bill KRC is under pressure to pay
after it was forced to hire cranes
from KPA. The firm deflected questions within its operational wing, the

mostly for hiring giant cranes to
handle cargo at the Mombasa Port
after the Chinese operator of the
Standard Gauge Railway supplied
it with dysfunctional equipment
worth at least Sh2 billion.
The Kenya Ports Authority (KPA),
which was forced to intervene to
rescue the situation, has now written to Kenya Railways demanding
payment, which includes related
support costs for operating the
cranes, creating friction between
the two key State agencies, with
the Chinese caught in the middle.
The KPA demand notice, which
put the hiring of the cranes alone
at Sh7.7 billion for the 13,104 hours
they have been used at the port of
Mombasa, also includes additional
costs comprising transfer of empty
containers from the SGR yards and
unnamed programmes implemented
by KPA in Mombasa and Nairobi.

project An Aijun wrote on July 19.
The dysfunctional cranes were
manufactured by Chinese crane
builder Henan Mine Crane Company Ltd. It remains unclear how
the firm, which boasts of supplying
electric hoists, electric winches and
different types of cranes including
the European standard overhead
crane, supplied the dysfunctional
ones in Mombasa that have failed to
work despite efforts to repair them
by experts from China.
The _Sunday Nation_ also tried to
contact the crane manufacturer in
vain, amid claims by insiders at the
Mombasa port that the crane builder
may have been counterfeited, with
the six giant cranes said to have
begun dropping containers, raising
safety concerns.
KRC is understood to have tried
to engage the Chinese railway
builder over the cranes without any
response in the past.
The next supplier, according to
the CRBC brief, is its own sister
company based in Shanghai. China

The dysfunctional rail-mounted
cranes at Port Reitz were set up at
Sh2 billion by CRBC as part of the
controversial SGR operations and
maintenance contract to handle
cargo on the Mombasa-Nairobi SGR.
Transport Cabinet Secretary
James Macharia had pledged to have
the cranes replaced.
Mr Macharia said he had met officials of CRBC in May and agreed to
replace the cranes in “a few weeks”.
“The cranes will be replaced by
CRBC. We had a meeting with
them on Thursday and that was the
agreement. The first two cranes are
expected to be replaced in the next
few weeks. I am made to understand
that their shipment has already
started. Eventually, we shall get
new replacements for the six,” Mr
Macharia told the _Sunday Nation_ .
The contractor is said to have
abandoned the equipment after they
malfunctioned.

t has been four years since a number
of Taita-Taveta residents received

gauge railway land but some have little
to show for it.
The millions of shillings turned the
residents’ fortunes in diff erent directions.
For Mr Ngavazi Muthungu of Birikani
area, the SGR project came as a blessing.
He used the sh1.4 million he received
from the government to buy a piece
of land where he put up a commercial
building.
Part of the monthly rent helped transform his retail shop into a wholesale
business.
“The compensation for the plot improved my life. My income has gone up
and my family lives in relative comfort,”
he told the _Nation_ .
However, Mr Muthungu did not receive
all the amount promised.
He was told that the piece of land



so I am entitled to all the amount. It is
my land,” the businessman said.
Mr Muthungu and others have visited
State agencies for help to no avail.
A few kilometres from his shop is an
incomplete double-storey building.
Its owner, Hamisi Mwasema, says he
could not fi nish its construction because
government offi cials undervalued his two
and a half acre piece.
Mr Mwasema says he had several
trees and a semi-permanent house on
his land “but my family only received
Sh13 million”.
Neighbours and relatives say when
Mr Mwasema got the money, he went
on a spending spree and blew most of
it on alcohol.
He bought a new saloon and a Mitsubishi Fuso lorry. He later constructed
a house for his family.
Area resident interviewed said the car
is grounded after being involved in an road accident recently.
He may not have the money to repair

to the Council of Legal Education to
license its law degree programmes
after a two-year row with the regulator.
CLE acting Chief Executive offi cer

School of Law application was being
reviewed.
The council stopped Moi University
from offering law courses in April
2016 because it did not meet the
requirements.
Dr Gakeri said an institution can
be allowed to train lawyers only
if it complies with the legal requirements, the fi rst bein g by fi rst
applying for a licence from the council.
“The application is assessed against
the quality standards to determine
whether it is compliant and if not, what
the institution should is escalate it to
the next level,"" he off ered.
He said the Department of Quality
Assurance, Compliance and Licensing
then ascertains the level of compliance with the quality standards.
“Subsequently, Council (board) conducts an on-site inspection of the
institution to determine whether it
has attained the requisite threshold
for licensing,” said Dr Gakeri.

reports that the latter is blocking
the review of their contract on
running the Madaraka Express
passenger and freight services.
The two firms said they are
reviewing the contract.
“The operations...have been
smooth for three years for passengers and two for freight. Since
the review of the agreement is
provided for in the contract, Kenya
Railways and Africa Star agreed
to undertake the review to align
the contract with the realities of
the operations,” KRC acting MD
Philip Mainga and Africa Star
General Manager Li Jiuping said
in a statement.
Speaking at Suswa Inland Container Deport earlier, Mr Mainga



businesses “since it is essentially
cheaper and less time-consuming”.
At the same time, Transport
Principal Secretary Esther Koimett said the Suswa ICD should
be viewed as a long-term investment.
The depot, which will be
launched on Tuesday, is expected
to begin operating on December
18.
Ms Koimett dismissed fears
that the Phase 2A of the standard
gauge railway to Naivasha is a
white elephant.
She said work is still in progress



with up to 70 per cent complete.
“With the favourable conditions
the site portends, it is only a matter of time before the envisioned
results are realised,” the PS said.
She cited the region’s conditions
“which will turn spur developments, including industrial parks
as well as tourist sites”.
The Sh6.9 billion Suswa ICD,
just a few kilometres from Maai
Mahiu SGR terminal, is intended
to serve freight destined for
Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, South
Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo via the port of
Mombasa.
“The ICD will essentially serve
cargo going west of Nairobi. Our
regional partners are upbeat about
the depot as it perfectly fi ts in the
government’s infrastructure plan,”
Ms Koimett said.
According to the PS, goods from
Mombasa conveyed by the railway
would be offl oaded at the ICD
station for onward transmission,
“which will ease further conveyance to subsequent destinations”.
“The fundamental benefi t is that
customers will no longer need to
go to Mombasa port or the Nairobi
ICD, but fetch them from Suswa,”

The latest People’s Shujaaz
Awards depicts a citizenry conscious and appreciation of female
lawmakers’ contributions in the
12th Parliament.
Women MPs took six awards
against three at the event facilitated
by Mzalendo Trust, an organisation
that monitors lawmakers’ perfor
mance.
The winners are nominated
senators Judith Pareno, Beatrice
Kwamboka, Naomi Waqo Jilo, Getrude Musuruve, Kajiado Woman
Rep Mary Seneta and Uasin Gishu
senator Margaret Kamar.
This is the fi rst time female parliamentarians have outshone their
male counterparts since the awards
were launched in 2014.
That year, only two female parliamentarians were awarded in the
10 categories. There were three
out of 12 in 2015, and two out of
six last year.
The awards are based on a public
vote. Kenyans vote through an online platform on the organisation’s
website.
It allows citizens to select the best
MP and senator who either contributed to or moved a motion, bill or
sought a statement corresponding
with the needs of the people.
Ms Pareno earned an award for
moving a motion on the development of ICT and teleconferencing
policy relating to connecting county"
